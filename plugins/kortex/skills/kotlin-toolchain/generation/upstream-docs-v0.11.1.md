# :octicons-terminal-16: Kotlin CLI

The Kotlin CLI is a command-line tool to build, run, test, and package your project without an IDE.
It is useful both locally and in CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

Install the Kotlin CLI using one of the methods below.
After installation, the `kotlin` command will be available on your `PATH`.

### via SDKMAN

```shell
sdk install kotlintoolchain
```

!!! note

    The first time you run the Kotlin CLI, it will take some time to download the Kotlin Toolchain distribution.
    Subsequent runs will be faster, as the downloaded files will be cached locally.

    If you just installed via the script, restart your shell (or run `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` on
    Linux/macOS) before using `kotlin`.

### via installer script

The installer script downloads the Kotlin CLI wrapper and places it in `~/.local/bin` (on Linux and macOS) or an
equivalent location on Windows.
It also updates your shell profile to add that directory to your `PATH`, if needed.

--8<-- "includes/cli-install.md"

??? success "IntelliJ IDEA can take care of this for you"

    New projects created using the IntelliJ IDEA wizard will already contain the
    [wrapper scripts](provisioning.md/#whats-the-wrapper-script).
    Also, if you create a `module.yaml` file in a blank project, IntelliJ IDEA will offer to set up the wrapper scripts
    for you. In that case, you can use `./kotlin` from the project root without a global installation.

## Exploring Kotlin CLI commands

The root `kotlin` command and all subcommands support the `-h` (or `--help`) option to explore what is possible:

```shell
kotlin --help       # shows the available commands and general options
kotlin build --help # shows the options for the 'build' command specifically
```

Useful commands:

- `kotlin init` to create a new Kotlin project
- `kotlin build` to compile and link all code in the project
- `kotlin run` to run your application
- `kotlin test` to run tests in the project
- `kotlin show (modules|settings|dependencies|tasks)` to introspect the project's configuration
- `kotlin clean` to remove the project's build output and caches

!!! example "Try it out!"

    Create a new project using the `kotlin init` command and select the *JVM console application* template.

    Then build and run the application using `kotlin run`.


## Tab-completion

If you’re using `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`, you can generate a completion script to source as part of your shell’s
configuration, to get tab completion for Kotlin CLI commands.

First, generate the completion script using the `generate-completion` command, specifying the shell you use:

=== "bash"

    ```shell
    kotlin generate-completion bash > ~/kotlin-completion.sh
    ```

=== "zsh"

    ```shell
    kotlin generate-completion zsh > ~/kotlin-completion.sh
    ```

=== "fish"

    ```shell
    kotlin generate-completion fish > ~/kotlin-completion.sh
    ```

Then load the script in your shell (this can be added to `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or similar configuration files to load it
automatically):

```shell
source ~/kotlin-completion.sh
```

You should now have tab completion available for Kotlin CLI subcommands, options, and option values.

## Updating the Kotlin Toolchain to a newer version

Run `kotlin update` to update the Kotlin CLI scripts and the toolchain distribution to the latest released version.
Use the `--dev` option if you want to try the bleeding edge dev build of the Kotlin Toolchain (no guarantees are made on these builds).

See `kotlin update -h` for more information about the available options.

!!! tip "Don't forget to regenerate your tab-completion script, if you have one."

# Wrapper script & provisioning

Part of our philosophy is to avoid the hassle of setting up toolchains, including the JDK and the Kotlin Toolchain itself.

The recommended way to use the Kotlin Toolchain is to check the Kotlin wrapper script into your project's root folder, so that anyone
cloning your project can just run `./kotlin build` and start working right away — that's it.
No installation needed, no matter their OS.

## What's the wrapper script?

The **Kotlin wrapper script** is a small file (`kotlin` or `kotlin.bat`) that downloads and runs the actual Kotlin CLI
application[^1], and serves as an entry point for all Kotlin CLI commands.

Of course, the Kotlin CLI application is only downloaded once (per version) and subsequent calls to the wrapper
immediately delegate to it.

[^1]: The Kotlin CLI is, at the moment, a JVM application. The Kotlin Toolchain distribution is therefore a bunch of JAR files, and
      they need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run. This is an implementation detail and may change in the future,
      so you should not rely on it.

## Concurrency

The provisioning mechanism and all relevant behaviors in the Kotlin Toolchain are designed to be safe to use concurrently.
This means you can run as many Kotlin CLI commands as you want in parallel, and they won't disturb each other.

## Bootstrap cache location

By default, when downloading the Kotlin Toolchain distribution, the wrapper script places it in a cache directory that is suitable
for the current OS:

| OS                                   | Cache directory                             |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| :material-apple: macOS               | `$HOME/Library/Caches/JetBrains/Kotlin/cli` |
| :material-linux: Linux               | `$HOME/.cache/JetBrains/Kotlin/cli`[^2]     |
| :material-microsoft-windows: Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JetBrains\Kotlin\cli`       |

[^2]: The XDG convention is not supported at the moment for the bootstrap cache.
      It is, however, respected for the regular Kotlin cache.

This location can be customized by setting the `KOTLIN_CLI_BOOTSTRAP_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

## Disabling the welcome banner

When the wrapper script downloads a distribution for the first time, it displays a welcome message to the user.
This might be too much output if you're running Kotlin CLI in a CI environment, and provisioning the distribution on every
build.

You can disable the welcome banner by setting the `KOTLIN_CLI_NO_WELCOME_BANNER` environment variable to a non-empty value.
For instance, `KOTLIN_CLI_NO_WELCOME_BANNER=1`.

## Uncharted customization territories

!!! danger "Use at your own risk"

    While the Kotlin CLI currently is a JVM application, this may change in the future and all the functionality below will break
    without notice (for instance, we could publish the Kotlin CLI as a GraalVM native image).

    Moreover, using these customization features is generally not recommended and may break the Kotlin Toolchain in unexpected ways,
    including the Kotlin Toolchain update mechanism.

### Customizing the Kotlin CLI's own JVM options

To add JVM options to the JVM running the Kotlin CLI, use the `KOTLIN_CLI_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable.

### Customizing the JRE used to run the Kotlin CLI

The Kotlin CLI runtime is not provisioned if the `KOTLIN_CLI_JAVA_HOME` environment variable is already provided.
Customizing this variable prevents the auto-provisioning of a JRE by the Kotlin CLI, but it puts the responsibility on you
to provide a valid JRE. The requirements for the JRE are subject to change without notice and are not documented at the
moment.

You can look inside the wrapper scripts to see which JRE is provisioned.

### Customizing the Kotlin Toolchain distribution URL

The Kotlin Toolchain distribution is downloaded from a Maven repository by fetching the following URL:
```
$KOTLIN_CLI_DOWNLOAD_ROOT/org/jetbrains/kotlin/kotlin-cli/${version}/kotlin-cli-${version}-dist.tgz
```
By default, `$KOTLIN_CLI_DOWNLOAD_ROOT` is `https://packages.jetbrains.team/maven/p/amper/amper`.
Changing this variable allows you to use your own Maven repository to host the Kotlin Toolchain distribution.

This is, again, not recommended — please use with care.

description: Frequently asked questions about the Kotlin Toolchain.
hide:
  - navigation
---
## General

### Is the Kotlin Toolchain a brand-new build tool from JetBrains?

The Kotlin Toolchain is a unified entry point into Kotlin with a focus on user experience and IDE support. It includes build tooling
functionality as one of its core components.

### Do you plan to support only Kotlin?

The Kotlin Toolchain already supports both Kotlin and Java as first-class citizens.
Also, because one of the Kotlin Toolchain's main targets is Kotlin Multiplatform projects, it supports Swift and Objective-C for iOS.

We’ll investigate other tech stacks in the future based on the demand for them.

### Which target platforms are supported?

Currently, you can create applications for the JVM, Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, but also JS and WASM (although
those cannot be run directly with the Kotlin CLI).

Libraries can be created for all Kotlin Multiplatform targets.

### Does the Kotlin Toolchain support Compose Multiplatform?

Yes, you can configure Compose for Android, iOS, and desktop.
Check out our [Compose Multiplatform guide](user-guide/builtin-tech/compose-multiplatform.md).

### Does the Kotlin Toolchain support Kotlin/JS or Kotlin/Wasm projects?

Yes, but it doesn't provide tooling to work on full stack web projects yet. For instance, the Kotlin Toolchain doesn't install any
browser or Node.js runtime, doesn't generate or process any HTML entry point, and cannot run `js/app` modules on its own.

### What functionality do you plan to support?

We plan to cover all the common use cases based on demand.
At the moment, we’re working on extensibility, publication, and exploring Maven migration and integration.

### Will the Kotlin Toolchain be open source?

The Kotlin Toolchain is already open source. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-toolchain) to see what we're
up to!

### When will the Kotlin Toolchain be released as stable?

Right now, we’re focusing on getting feedback and understanding your needs. Based on that, we’ll be able to provide a
more accurate estimate of a release date sometime in the future.

### Should I start my next project with the Kotlin Toolchain?

You’re welcome to use it in any type of project. However, please understand that the Kotlin Toolchain is still in the alpha
phase, and we expect some things to change.

### Should I migrate my existing projects?

Understanding real-world scenarios is crucial for us to provide a better experience, so from our side we’d love
to hear about the challenges you may face porting existing projects. However, please understand that the project is
still in the experimental phase, and we cannot guarantee that all scenarios can be supported.

### How do I report a bug?

Please report problems to our [:jetbrains-youtrack: YouTrack issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/AMPER).
Since this project is in the experimental phase, we would also greatly appreciate feedback and suggestions regarding
the configuration experience – join our
[:material-slack: Slack channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C062WG3A7T8) for discussion.

### Why don’t you use Kotlin for the Kotlin Toolchain's configuration files?

Currently, we use YAML as a simple and readable markup language. It allows us to experiment with the UX and the IDE
support much faster. We’ll review the language choice as we proceed with the design and based on demand. The Kotlin DSL,
or a limited form thereof, is one of the possible options.

Having said that, we believe that the declarative approach to project configuration has significant advantages over the
imperative approach. Declarative configuration is easily toolable, recovery from errors is much easier, and
interpretation is much faster. These properties are critical for a good UX.

Our final language choice will be made based on the overall UX it provides.

### Why not simply improve Gradle?

We believe there is room to improve the project configuration experience and IDE support.
With the Kotlin Toolchain, we want to show you our design and get your feedback, as it will help us to decide which direction to take
the design.

At the same time, we are also [working with the Gradle team](https://blog.gradle.org/declarative-gradle) to improve
Gradle support in our IDEs and Gradle itself.

### What about Gradle extensibility and plugins?

We aim to support most of the Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform use cases out of the box and offer a reasonable level of
extensibility.

## Usage

### What are the requirements to use the Kotlin Toolchain?

The Kotlin CLI doesn't require any software preinstallation, except the Xcode toolchain if you want to
build iOS applications. See the [CLI instructions](cli/index.md).

We recommend using the latest [IntelliJ IDEA EAP](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/) to make the most out of
the Kotlin Toolchain. Our focus on the tooling and UX really pays off in IntelliJ IDEA. To learn about the required and optional
plugins in IntelliJ IDEA, see the [IDE setup instructions](getting-started/ide-setup.md).

### How do I create a new Kotlin project?

You have several options:

* Open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new Kotlin project with the Kotlin Toolchain

* Kick-start your project using one of the [examples]({{ examples_base_url }})

* Download Kotlin CLI by following the [CLI instructions](cli/index.md), and generate a project
  from a template using the `./kotlin init` command.

### How do I create a multi-module project in the Kotlin Toolchain?

See the documentation on the [project layout](user-guide/basics.md#project-layout).

### Is there an automated migration tool?

Not currently, but it's certainly something we’re looking into.

### Feature X is not yet supported, what can I do?

Please let us know about it! We're eager to hear what you're trying to do, because we plan to expand the list of
supported use cases based on demand.
Please submit your requests and suggestions in the
[:jetbrains-youtrack: YouTrack issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/AMPER) or join the
[:material-slack: Slack channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C062WG3A7T8) for discussions.

### Can I write a custom task or use a plugin?

Yes! The Kotlin Toolchain now includes a preview of a plugin system. See the dedicated [docs](user-guide/plugins/overview.md).

# IDE Setup

??? question "Do I need to use IntelliJ IDEA?"

    The Kotlin Toolchain includes a command line tool that stands on its own, so using IntelliJ IDEA is not required.
    If you prefer to work directly with the terminal or in another IDE, check out the [Kotlin CLI](../cli/index.md).

    However, to make the most out of the Kotlin Toolchain and its toolability, we recommend using IntelliJ IDEA.
    There are tons of diagnostics and quick fixes that make your life a bliss when working with the Kotlin Toolchain.

1. Preferably use the latest [:jetbrains-intellij-idea: IntelliJ IDEA EAP](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/).
   The best way to get the most recent IDE versions is by using the [:jetbrains-toolbox-app: Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/toolbox/).

2. Make sure to install the [:jetbrains-amper: Kotlin Toolchain plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23076-amper):

   ![](../images/ij-plugin.png)

3. [Optional] If you want to write code for :material-apple: Apple platforms or share code between several platforms,
   install the [:jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform).

4. [Optional] If you want to write some Android-specific code, also install the
   [:android-head-flat: Android plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22989-android).

  Migrate your Maven project to the Kotlin Toolchain: run the semi-automated converter, understand the concept mapping, and learn
  what to do after the conversion.

# Migrating from Maven

This section describes how to convert an existing Maven project to the Kotlin Toolchain.

The Kotlin Toolchain provides a semi-automated tool to do the bulk of the conversion for you.
It works on a best-effort basis, so some projects require some additional tweaks
after the converter runs.

To run the migration tool, go to the root of your Maven project:

```bash

cd /path/to/your/maven/project

```

Install the [Kotlin CLI](../cli/index.md#installation):

--8<-- "includes/cli-install.md"

Then run:

```bash
kotlin tool convert-project
```

The path to your `pom.xml` can be provided explicitly via `--pom` argument. The `pom.xml` file is a starting point.
If it's a part of the reactor, all related modules are converted.

During the conversion, the tool puts the Kotlin Toolchain files into corresponding Maven modules's folders. If `project.yaml` or one of
the corresponding `module.yaml` files already exists, by default converter fails. To adjust this behavior,
`--overwrite-existing` flag can be used.

## How it works

### Project structure

The converter creates:

- `project.yaml` at the reactor root, with the list of modules
- `module.yaml` in every module directory, both in single-module projects and in multi-module reactor projects

All converted modules use `layout: maven-like`, so your existing `src/main/java`, `src/test/kotlin`, etc. directories
continue to work without moving any files. See [Maven-like layout](../user-guide/advanced/maven-like-layout.md)
for details.

### Dependencies

- **Reactor module dependencies** are converted to relative path dependencies (e.g., `- ../my-lib`)
- **External dependencies** keep their Maven coordinates (`group:artifact:version`)
- **Parent POM BOMs** are automatically imported as `bom:` dependencies (including their transitive parents in order
  from the most root to the most nested)
- **Repositories** (including those inherited from parent POMs) are added to the `repositories` section.
- **Publishing coordinates** (`groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`) are extracted into `settings.publishing`.

### Maven plugin handling

The converter handles Maven plugins in two ways:

**Handled natively** — these plugins cover functionality that the Kotlin Toolchain provides out of the box.
For some of them, the converter extracts the relevant configuration into the Kotlin Toolchain settings:

| Maven plugin               | The Kotlin Toolchain settings                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `maven-compiler-plugin`    | `settings.jvm.release`, `settings.java.freeCompilerArgs`, `settings.java.annotationProcessing`, `settings.jvm.storeParameterNames` |
| `kotlin-maven-plugin`      | `settings.kotlin.*` (version, compiler plugins, args), `settings.jvm.release`                                                      |
| `spring-boot-maven-plugin` | `settings.springBoot`, `product: jvm/app`, `settings.jvm.mainClass`                                                                |
| `maven-surefire-plugin`    | `test-settings.jvm.freeJvmArgs`, `test-settings.jvm.extraEnvironment`, `test-settings.jvm.systemProperties`                        |

Others (`maven-jar-plugin`, `maven-clean-plugin`, `maven-install-plugin`, `maven-source-plugin`, etc.)
don't require any conversion because the Kotlin Toolchain handles their functionality out of the box.

**Unknown plugins** — all other plugins are downloaded, their descriptors are parsed, and each goal is added to a
`mavenPlugins` section with `enabled: false`. You can enable them selectively after the conversion.

For example, a project using `maven-enforcer-plugin` and `jacoco-maven-plugin` would produce:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
mavenPlugins:
  maven-enforcer-plugin.enforce:
    enabled: false
    configuration:
      rules: |-
        <rules>
          <requireJavaVersion>
            <version>17</version>
          </requireJavaVersion>
        </rules>
  jacoco-maven-plugin.prepare-agent:
    enabled: false
```

The `mavenPlugins` section allows you to run third-party Maven plugins directly in your Kotlin project.
However, not all plugins are guaranteed to work, so by default they are disabled. You can selectively enable
plugins you need by setting `enabled: true` in their configuration after the conversion.
Please refer to the [Maven plugins](../user-guide/advanced/maven-plugins.md) section for more details.

## Dependency mapping

Maven dependency scopes map to the Kotlin Toolchain as follows:

| Maven scope         | The Kotlin Toolchain equivalent          | Config section      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `compile` (default) | `compile` + `runtime` + `exported: true` | `dependencies`      |
| `provided`          | `scope: compile-only`                    | `dependencies`      |
| `runtime`           | `scope: runtime-only`                    | `dependencies`      |
| `test`              | `compile` + `runtime`                    | `test-dependencies` |
| `system`            | Not supported                            | —                   |
| `import` (BOM)      | `bom:` prefix                            | `dependencies`      |

!!! note

    The converter marks all `compile`-scoped dependencies as `exported: true`. This is the safe default because
    Maven's `compile` scope makes dependencies transitively visible. After conversion, consider removing `exported`
    from implementation-only dependencies that are not part of your module's public API.
    See [When to use exported](../user-guide/dependencies.md#when-to-use-exported).

Example:

<div class="grid" markdown>

```xml title="pom.xml"

<dependencies>
    <dependency>

## After the conversion

After the converter finishes, consider the following steps:

1. **Build and test.** Run `./kotlin build` and `./kotlin test` to verify the conversion.

2. **Review generated files.** Check `project.yaml` and each `module.yaml` for correctness.

3. **Review dependency visibility.** The converter marks all `compile`-scoped dependencies as `exported`.
   Remove `exported` from dependencies that are only used internally and are not part of the module's public API.

4. **Review the `mavenPlugins` section.** For unknown plugins:
    - Set `enabled: true` for plugins you actually need.
    - Remove entries for plugins you don't need.
    - Plugin coordinates are listed in `project.yaml` and can be cleaned up as well.

5. **Optional: create a library catalog.** Extract repeated dependency versions into a `libs.versions.toml` file.
   See [Library catalogs](../user-guide/dependencies.md#library-catalogs).

6. **Optional: switch to the standard Kotlin Toolchain layout.** The converter sets `layout: maven-like` to avoid moving files.
   If you want to adopt the [standard Kotlin Toolchain layout](../user-guide/basics.md#project-layout) later, move files from
   `src/main/kotlin/` to `src/` and from `src/test/kotlin/` to `test/`, then remove the `layout: maven-like` line.
   See [Maven-like layout](../user-guide/advanced/maven-like-layout.md).

## Limitations

The following Maven features are not handled by the converter and require manual migration:

- **Profiles** — The Kotlin Toolchain does not have an equivalent of Maven profiles. Build configuration can only vary
  [by platform](../user-guide/multiplatform.md).
- **Extensions**
- **Dependency exclusions**
- **Dependency classifiers**
- **Optional dependencies**
- **System-scoped dependencies**
- **Variable substitution** — values are inlined where possible. For dependencies, it's recommended to use a
  [library catalog](../user-guide/dependencies.md#library-catalogs).

# Tutorial

This tutorial gives a short introduction to the Kotlin Toolchain and shows how to create and configure a new project, step-by-step.
If you are looking for a detailed comprehensive documentation, check the [User guide](../user-guide/index.md) instead.

!!! tip "Before you start"

    The Kotlin Toolchain is designed with IDE support in mind, and much of the UX comes from the IDE.
    While the [Kotlin CLI](../cli/index.md) works well with any text editor, we recommend using
    :jetbrains-intellij-idea: IntelliJ IDEA[^1] to get the most out of Kotlin.

    That said, it is not required for this tutorial – there are no IDE-specific steps.

[^1]: Since the Kotlin Toolchain is moving fast, it's best to use the latest
      [IntelliJ IDEA EAP](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/) version.
      The best way to get the most recent IDE versions is by using the
      [:jetbrains-toolbox-app: Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/toolbox/).
      Also, don't forget to install the [Kotlin Toolchain plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23076-amper).

## Step 1. Hello, World

The first thing you’d want to try when getting familiar with a new tool is just a simple "Hello, World" application.
Here is what we do:

Create a `module.yaml` file at the root of your project:

```YAML title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/app
```

And add some code in the `src/` folder:

<div class="grid" markdown>
``` title="Project structure"  hl_lines="1 2"
├─ src/
│  ╰─ main.kt
╰─ module.yaml
```

```kotlin title="main.kt"
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```
</div>

You also need to add the Kotlin CLI wrapper scripts to your root project folder.

* If you're in IntelliJ IDEA, you can simply use the quick fix in `module.yaml` to "Configure the Kotlin Toolchain".
* If not, follow the [CLI installation instructions](./../cli/index.md#installation) to download them.

Your project should now look like this:
``` hl_lines="3 4"
├─ src/
│  ╰─ main.kt
├─ kotlin
├─ kotlin.bat
╰─ module.yaml
```

That’s it, we’ve just created a simple JVM application.

And since it’s a JVM project, you can add Java code. Java and Kotlin files can reside together,
no need to create separate Maven-like `java/` and `kotlin/` folders:

``` hl_lines="3"
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.kt
│  ╰─ JavaClass.java
├─ kotlin
├─ kotlin.bat
╰─ module.yaml
```

You can now build your application using `./kotlin build`, or run it using `./kotlin run`.

??? info "Run it directly from IntelliJ IDEA"

    If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the :intellij-run: Run icon in any of those places:

      * next to the `product: ` section in `module.yaml`:

      ![img.png](../images/ij-run-product.png)

      * next to the `main()` function in `main.kt`:

      ![](../images/ij-run-main.png)

      * in the main toolbar

!!! abstract "Related documentation"

    - [Project layout](../user-guide/basics.md#project-layout)
    - [Module file anatomy](../user-guide/basics.md#module-file-anatomy)
    - [Using the Kotlin CLI](../cli/index.md)

## Step 2. Add dependencies

Let's add a dependency on a Kotlin library using its Maven coordinates:

```YAML title="module.yaml" hl_lines="3 4"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
  - org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-datetime:0.6.2
```

We can now use this library in the `main.kt` file:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.datetime.*

fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
    println("It's ${Clock.System.now().toLocalDateTime(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault())} here")
}
```

!!! abstract "Related documentation: [Dependencies](../user-guide/dependencies.md)"

## Step 3. Add tests

Now let’s add some tests. The Kotlin Toolchain configures the testing framework automatically,
we only need to add some test code into the `test/` folder:

<div class="grid" markdown>
``` title="Project structure" hl_lines="3 4"
├─ src/
│  ╰─ ...
├─ test/
│  ╰─ MyTest.kt
├─ kotlin
├─ kotlin.bat
╰─ module.yaml
‎
```

```kotlin title="MyTest.kt"
import kotlin.test.*

class MyTest {
    @Test
    fun doTest() {
        assertTrue(true)
    }
}
```
</div>

To add test-specific dependencies, use the dedicated `test-dependencies` section.
This should be very familiar to Cargo, Flutter and Poetry users.
As an example, let's add the MockK library to the project:

```YAML title="module.yaml" hl_lines="6 7"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
  - org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-datetime:0.6.2

test-dependencies:
  - io.mockk:mockk:1.13.10
```

!!! example "Example: [JVM "Hello, World!"]({{ examples_base_url }}/jvm)"

!!! abstract "Related documentation: [Testing](../user-guide/testing.md)"

## Step 4. Configure Java and Kotlin

Another typical task is configuring compiler settings, such as language level etc. Here is how to do it:

```YAML title="module.yaml" hl_lines="9-13"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
  - org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-datetime:0.6.2

test-dependencies:
  - io.mockk:mockk:1.13.10

settings:
  kotlin:
    version: 2.2.21  # Set Kotlin compiler version to 2.2.21
  jvm:
    release: 17  # Set the minimum JVM version that the Kotlin and Java code should be compatible with.
```

!!! abstract "Related documentation: [Settings](../user-guide/basics.md#settings)"

## Step 5. Add a UI with Compose

Now, let's turn the example into a GUI application.
To do that we'll add the [Compose Multiplatform framework](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform).
It allows building plain JVM desktop apps, which are simple for now, and paves the way for turning multiplatform later.

Let's change our `module.yaml` to:
```YAML
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
  # ...other dependencies...

  # add Compose dependencies
  - $compose.foundation
  - $compose.material3
  - $compose.desktop.currentOs

settings:
  # ...other settings...

  # enable the Compose framework toolchain
  compose:
    enabled: true
```

!!! note

    The `$compose.*` dependencies are declared with a special reference syntax here.
    These are references to the Compose toolchain library catalog, and are available because we enabled the toolchain.
    Read more in the [Library catalogs](../user-guide/dependencies.md#library-catalogs) section.

We can then replace the contents of `main.kt` with the following code:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.foundation.text.BasicText
import androidx.compose.ui.window.Window
import androidx.compose.ui.window.application

fun main() = application {
    Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication) {
        BasicText("Hello, World!")
    }
}
```

Now we have a GUI application!

!!! example "Examples"

    - [Compose Desktop]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-desktop)
    - [Compose Android]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-android)
    - [Compose iOS]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-ios)
    - [Compose Multiplatform]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-multiplatform)

!!! abstract "Related documentation: [Compose Multiplatform](../user-guide/builtin-tech/compose-multiplatform.md)"

## Step 6. Modularize

Let's split our project into a JVM application and a library module, with shared code that we are going to reuse later
when making the project multiplatform.

Our goal here is to separate our app into a `shared` library module and a `jvm-app` application module and reach the
following structure:
```
├─ jvm-app/
│  ├─ ...
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ shared/
│  ├─ ...
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ kotlin
├─ kotlin.bat
╰─ project.yaml
```

First let's move our current `src`, `test` and `module.yaml` files into a new `jvm-app` directory:
``` hl_lines="1-6"
├─ jvm-app/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ╰─ main.kt
│  ├─ test/
│  │  ╰─ ...
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ kotlin
╰─ kotlin.bat
```

Add a `project.yaml` file in the root, next to the existing `kotlin` and `kotlin.bat` files, with the following content:

```yaml title="project.yaml"
modules:
  - ./jvm-app
  - ./shared
```

If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, you should see a warning that the `shared` module is missing, and you can automatically
create it from here. Otherwise, just create a new `shared` directory manually, with `src` and `test` directories, and
a `module.yaml` with the following content:

```YAML
product: jvm/lib

dependencies:
  - $compose.foundation: exported #(1)!
  - $compose.material3: exported
  - $compose.desktop.currentOs: exported

settings:
  compose:
    enabled: true
```

1. The `exported` keyword here means that the library exposes its dependencies to the dependent module's compilation.
   That module will therefore be able to use these dependencies in its code without depending on them.
   Read more about transitivity in the [Transitivity](../user-guide/dependencies.md#transitivity) section.

We can now change our `jvm-app/module.yaml` to depend on the `shared` module:

```yaml hl_lines="4"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
  - ../shared #(1)!

settings:
  compose:
    enabled: true
```

1. The dependency on the `shared` module is declared using a relative path. Read more about module dependencies in the
   [Module dependencies](../user-guide/dependencies.md#module-dependencies) section.

Let's extract the common code into a new `shared/src/hello.kt` file:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.foundation.text.BasicText
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable

@Composable
fun sayHello() {
    BasicText("Hello, World!")
}
```

And re-use it in the `jvm-app/src/main.kt` file:

```kotlin hl_lines="6"
import androidx.compose.ui.window.Window
import androidx.compose.ui.window.application

fun main() = application {
    Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication) {
        sayHello()
    }
}
```

We now have a multi-module project with some neatly extracted shared code.

!!! example "Example: [Compose Multiplatform]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-multiplatform)"

!!! abstract "Related documentation"

    - [Project layout](../user-guide/basics.md#project-layout)
    - [Module dependencies](../user-guide/dependencies.md#module-dependencies)
    - [Dependency visibility and scope](../user-guide/dependencies.md#transitivity-and-scope)

## Step 7. Make the project multiplatform

So far we've been working with the JVM platform to create a desktop application.
Let's add an Android and an iOS application.
It will be straightforward, since we've already prepared a multi-module layout with a shared module that we can reuse.

Here is the project structure that we need:

```
├─ android-app/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ main.kt
│  │  ╰─ AndroidManifest.xml
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ ios-app/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ iosApp.swift
│  │  ╰─ main.kt
│  ├─ module.yaml
│  ╰─ module.xcodeproj
├─ jvm-app/
│  ╰─ ...
├─ shared/
│  ╰─ ...
╰─ project.yaml
```

Remember to add the new modules into the `project.yaml` file:

```yaml hl_lines="2-3"
modules:
  - ./android-app
  - ./ios-app
  - ./jvm-app
  - ./shared
```

The new module files will look like this:

<div class="grid" markdown>
```yaml title="android-app/module.yaml"
product: android/app

dependencies:
  - ../shared

settings:
  compose:
    enabled: true
```

```yaml title="ios-app/module.yaml"
product: ios/app

dependencies:
  - ../shared

settings:
  compose:
    enabled: true
```
</div>

Let's update the `shared/module.yaml` to turn it into a Kotlin Multiplatform library by changing `jvm/lib` to `kmp/lib`,
and add the new platforms and a couple of additional dependencies for Android:

```yaml hl_lines="3 9-10 12-15"
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [ jvm, android, iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64, iosX64 ]

dependencies:
  - $compose.foundation: exported
  - $compose.material3: exported

dependencies@jvm:
  - $compose.desktop.currentOs: exported

dependencies@android:
  # Compose integration with Android activities
  - androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.7.2: exported
  - androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1: exported

settings:
  compose:
    enabled: true
```

Note how we used the `dependencies@jvm:` and `dependencies@android:` sections to specify JVM- and Android-specific dependencies.
These dependencies will be added to the JVM and Android versions of the `shared` library correspondingly.
They will also be available for the `jvm-app` and `android-app` modules, since they depend on the `shared` module.
Read more about multiplatform configuration in the [Multiplatform modules](../user-guide/multiplatform.md) section.

Now, as we have the module structure, we need to add platform-specific application code to the Android and iOS modules.
Create a `MainActivity.kt` file in `android-app/src` with the following content:

```kotlin
package hello.world

import sayHello
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.activity.compose.setContent
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            sayHello()
        }
    }
}
```

Next, create a `ViewController.kt` file in `ios-app/src`:

```kotlin
import sayHello
import androidx.compose.ui.window.ComposeUIViewController

fun ViewController() = ComposeUIViewController {
    sayHello()
}
```

And the last step, copy the [AndroidManifest.xml file from an example project]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-multiplatform/android-app/src/AndroidManifest.xml)
into `android-app/src` folder, and the [iosApp.swift file]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-multiplatform/ios-app/src/iosApp.swift) into the `ios-app/src`.
These files bind the Compose UI code with the native application entry points.

Make sure that your project structure looks like this:
``` hl_lines="4 8"
├─ android-app/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ main.kt
│  │  ╰─ AndroidManifest.xml
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ ios-app/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ iosApp.swift
│  │  ╰─ main.kt
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ jvm-app/
├─ shared/
╰─ ...
```

Now you can build and run both apps using the corresponding IntelliJ IDEA run configurations, or use the CLI commands:
```shell
./kotlin run -m android-app
```
```shell
./kotlin run -m ios-app
```

!!! note

    After the first build, the Xcode project will appear beside the `module.yaml` in the `ios-app` module.
    It can be checked into the VCS and customized (e.g. _Team_ (`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`) setting).
    See the [iOS application](../user-guide/product-types/ios-app.md) section to learn more about the Xcode ↔ the Kotlin Toolchain
    interoperability.

!!! example "Example: [Compose Multiplatform]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-multiplatform)"

!!! abstract "Related documentation"

    - [multiplatform configuration](../user-guide/multiplatform.md)
    - [Compose](../user-guide/builtin-tech/compose-multiplatform.md)

## Step 8. Deduplicate common configuration

You might have noticed that there are some settings present in multiple `module.yaml` files.
To reduce duplication we can extract them into a template.

Let's create a couple of template files:

<div class="grid" markdown>
<div>
``` title="Project structure" hl_lines="9-10"
├─ android-app/
│  ╰─ ...
├─ ios-app/
│  ╰─ ...
├─ jvm-app/
│  ╰─ ...
├─ shared/
│  ╰─ ...
├─ compose.module-template.yaml
╰─ app.module-template.yaml
```
</div>
<div>
```yaml title="compose.module-template.yaml"
settings:
  compose:
    enabled: true
```

```yaml title="app.module-template.yaml"
dependencies:
  - ./shared
```
</div>
</div>

Now we will apply these templates to our module files:

```yaml title="shared/module.yaml" hl_lines="5-6"
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [ jvm, android, iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64, iosX64 ]

apply:
  - ../compose.module-template.yaml

dependencies:
  - $compose.foundation: exported
  - $compose.material3: exported

dependencies@jvm:
  - $compose.desktop.currentOs

dependencies@android:
  # Compose integration with Android activities
  - androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.7.2: exported
  - androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1: exported
```

```yaml title="jvm-app/module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

apply:
  - ../compose.module-template.yaml
  - ../app.module-template.yaml
```

```yaml title="android-app/module.yaml"
product: android/app

apply:
  - ../compose.module-template.yaml
  - ../app.module-template.yaml
```

```yaml title="ios-app/module.yaml"
product: ios/app

apply:
  - ../compose.module-template.yaml
  - ../app.module-template.yaml
```

You can put all common dependencies and settings into the template. It's also possible to have multiple templates
for various typical configurations in the project.

# Module file reference

## `aliases`

An alias can be used to share code, dependencies, and/or settings between a group of platforms that doesn't already
have a name (an exclusive common ancestor) in the default hierarchy. Aliases can be used as `@platform` qualifiers in the settings.

Read more in the [Multiplatform](../user-guide/multiplatform.md#aliases) section.

Example:

```yaml
# Create an alias to share code between JVM and Android platforms.
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [ jvm, android, iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64 ]

aliases:
  - jvmAndAndroid: [jvm, android]

# Dependencies for JVM and Android platforms:
dependencies@jvmAndAndroid:
  ...
```

## `apply`

The `apply` section lists the templates applied to the module.
Read more in the [Module templates](../user-guide/templates.md) section.

Use `- ./<relative path>` or `- ../<relative path>` notation, where the `<relative path>` points at a template file.

Example:

```yaml
# Apply a `common.module-template.yaml` template to the module
product: jvm/app

apply:
  - ../common.module-template.yaml
```

## `dependencies` and `test-dependencies`

The `dependencies` section defines the list of modules and libraries necessary to build the module.
Certain dependencies can also be exported as part of the module API.
Read more in the [Dependencies](../user-guide/dependencies.md) section.

The `test-dependencies` section defines the dependencies necessary to build and run tests of the module.
Read more in the [Testing](../user-guide/testing.md) section.

Supported dependency types:

| Notation                                         | Description                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `- ./<relative path>`<br/>`- ../<relative path>` | Dependency on [another module](../user-guide/dependencies.md#module-dependencies) in the codebase.                         |
| `- <group ID>:<artifact ID>:<version>`           | Dependency on [a Kotlin or Java library](../user-guide/dependencies.md#external-maven-dependencies) in a Maven repository. |
| `- $<catalog.key>`                               | Dependency from [a dependency catalog](../user-guide/dependencies.md#library-catalogs).                                    |
| `- bom: <group ID>:<artifact ID>:<version>`      | Dependency on [a BOM](../user-guide/dependencies.md#using-a-maven-bom).                                                    |
| `- bom: $<catalog.key>`                          | Dependency on [a BOM from a dependency catalog](../user-guide/dependencies.md#library-catalogs).                           |

Each dependency (except BOM) has the following attributes:

| Attribute           | Default | Description                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `exported: boolean` | `false` | Whether a dependency should be [visible as a part of a published API](../user-guide/dependencies.md#transitivity-and-scope).       |
| `scope: enum`       | `all`   | When the dependency should be used. Read more about the [dependency scopes](../user-guide/dependencies.md#transitivity-and-scope). |

Available scopes:

| Scopes         | Description                                                                                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `all`          | The dependency is available during compilation and runtime.                                                |
| `compile-only` | The dependency is only available during compilation. This is a 'provided' dependency in Maven terminology. |
| `runtime-only` | The dependency is not available during compilation, but available during testing and running.              |

Examples:

```yaml
# Short form for the dependency attributes
dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0                   # Kotlin or Java dependency
  - org.postgresql:postgresql:42.3.3: runtime-only
  - ../common-types: exported                        # Dependency on another module in the codebase
  - $compose.foundation                              # Dependency from the 'compose' catalog
  - bom: io.ktor:ktor-bom:2.2.0                      # Importing BOM
  - io.ktor:ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json          # Kotlin or Java dependency with a version resolved from BOM
```

```yaml
# Full form for the dependency attributes
dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0
  - ../common-types:
      exported: true
      scope: all
  - org.postgresql:postgresql:42.3.3:
      exported: false
      scope: runtime-only
```

The `dependencies` section can also be [qualified with a platform](../user-guide/multiplatform.md#platform-qualifier):

```yaml
# Dependencies used to build the common part of the product
dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0

# Dependencies used to build the JVM part of the product
dependencies@jvm:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-java:2.2.0
  - org.postgresql:postgresql:42.3.3: runtime-only
```

## `description`

An optional description of the module. This description supports Markdown formatting and can span multiple lines.

When writing multiline descriptions, the first line should act as a short summary that can stand on its own, like
commit messages. Only the first line is displayed by default in `./kotlin show modules`.

This description is used by the CLI and by IDEs to show information about the module.
For libraries, it is also used as a description in published metadata by default.

## `layout`

The `layout` defines the module file structure. Valid values:

* `amper`: place your files in `src`, `test`, and `resources` directories
* `maven-like`: just like Maven (`src/main/kotlin`, `src/main/java`, `src/test/kotlin`, `src/main/resources`)

The default value is `amper`.

!!! warning "The `maven-like` layout is only supported in modules with `jvm/app` or `jvm/lib` product type."

Examples:

```yaml
product: jvm/app

layout: maven-like

settings:
  # ...

```

## `pluginInfo`

The `pluginInfo` section is only available if the `product.type` is `jvm/amper-plugin`.
It configures plugin-specific build settings.

| Attribute                 | Default                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id: string`              | Module name                 | The ID that is used to refer to the plugin in the configuration files.                                                                                                                          |
| ~~`description: string`~~ | `null`                      | **Deprecated**. Use the plugin module's top-level `description` instead.                                                                                                                        |
| `settingsClass: string`   | `null` (no plugin settings) | The fully qualified name of the @Configurable-annotated interface to be used as plugin configuration. This interface can't come from a dependency, it must be declared in the source directory. |

## `product`

The `product` section defines what should be produced out of the module.
Read more about the [product types](../user-guide/basics.md#product-type).

| Attribute             | Default               | Description                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `platform: enum list` | (derived from `type`) | What platforms to generate the product for. |
| `type: enum`          | -                     | What type of product to generate.           |

Supported product types and platforms:

| Product Type       | Description                                                                              | Platforms                                                        |

#### `settings.android.parcelize`

`settings.android.parcelize` configures [Parcelize](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/parcelize) for the Android
platform in the module. The value can be the simple `enabled` string, or an object with the following attributes:

| Attribute                            | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled: boolean`                   | `false` | Whether to enable [Parcelize](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/parcelize). When enabled, an implementation of the `Parcelable` interface is automatically generated for classes annotated with `@Parcelize`.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `additionalAnnotations: string list` | `[]`    | The full-qualified names of additional annotations that should be considered as `@Parcelize`. This is useful if you need to annotate classes in common code shared between different platforms, where the real `@Parcelize` annotation is not available. In that case, create your own common annotation and add its fully-qualified name so that Parcelize recognizes it. |

```yaml title="Short form"
# Enables Parcelize to process @Parcelize-annotated classes
settings:
  android:
    parcelize: enabled
```

```yaml title="Custom annotation"
# Configures Parcelize to process a custom @com.example.MyCommonParcelize annotation
settings:
  android:
    parcelize:
      enabled: true
      additionalAnnotations: [ com.example.MyCommonParcelize ]
```

These requirements are used to validate `JAVA_HOME` or to provision a matching JDK automatically. See details below and the [JDK provisioning](../user-guide/advanced/jdk-provisioning.md) page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This enforces compatibility on 3 levels. First, it is used as the target version for the bytecode generated from Kotlin and Java sources. Second, it limits the Java platform APIs available to Kotlin and Java sources. Third, it limits the Java language constructs in Java sources. If this is set to null, these constraints are not applied and the compiler defaults are used. |
| `runtimeClasspathMode: enum`   | `jars`                                                  | How the runtime classpath is constructed: `jars` (default) builds local module dependencies as jars; `classes` uses compiled classes for local modules on the runtime classpath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `storeParameterNames: boolean` | `false`                                                 | Enables storing formal parameter names of constructors and methods in the generated class files.

#### `settings.jvm.jdk`

Configures how the Kotlin Toolchain selects or provisions a JDK for the module. If `JAVA_HOME` points to a suitable JDK, Kotlin Toolchain can use it; otherwise it can download a matching JDK via the Foojay Discovery API and cache it. See the [JDK provisioning](../user-guide/advanced/jdk-provisioning.md) page for a deep dive.

The `serialization` attribute is an object with the following properties:

| Attribute          | Default                | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled: boolean` | `false`                | Enable the `@Serializable` annotation processing, and add the core serialization library. When enabled, a built-in catalog for kotlinx.serialization format dependencies is provided. |
| `version: string`  | `1.10.0`               | The version to use for the core serialization library and the serialization formats.                                                                                                  |
| `format: enum`     | `none` (only core lib) | A shortcut for `enabled: true` and adding the given serialization format dependency. For instance, `json` adds the JSON format in addition to enabling serialization.                 |

You can also use a short form and directly specify `serialization: enabled` or `serialization: json`.

Examples:

```yaml
# Set Kotlin language version and opt-ins
settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.8
    optIns: [ kotlin.io.path.ExperimentalPathApi ]
```

```yaml
# Enable Kotlin Serialization with the JSON format
settings:
  kotlin:
    serialization: json
```

```yaml
# Enable Kotlin Serialization with the JSON format and a specific version
settings:
  kotlin:
    serialization:
      format: json
      version: 1.9.0
```

```yaml
# Enable Kotlin Serialization with multiple formats
settings:
  kotlin:
    serialization: enabled

dependencies:
  - $kotlin.serialization.json
  - $kotlin.serialization.protobuf
```

```yaml
# Enable Kotlin Serialization with multiple formats and a specific version
settings:
  kotlin:
    serialization:
      enabled: true
      version: 1.9.0

dependencies:
  - $kotlin.serialization.json
  - $kotlin.serialization.protobuf
```

description: An exhaustive reference of the project file format.

# Project file reference

## `modules`

The `modules` section defines which modules are part of this Kotlin project.

Each list element must be the path to a module directory[^1], relative to the project root.
If a `module.yaml` is present in the project root, that root module is always included implicitly and doesn’t need to
be listed.

[^1]: That is, a directory that directly contains a `module.yaml`

Example:

```yaml
# include the `app` and `lib1` modules explicitly:
modules:
  - ./app
  - ./libs/lib1
```

You can also use [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) to include multiple module
directories at once. Only directories that contain a `module.yaml` file are taken into account:

```yaml
# include all direct subfolders in the `plugins` dir that contain `module.yaml` files:
modules:
  - ./plugins/*
```

Globs may contain the following special characters:

- `*` matches zero or more characters of a path name component without crossing directory boundaries
- `?` matches exactly one character of a path name component
- `[abc]` matches exactly one character of the given set (here `a`, `b`, or `c`). A dash (`-`) can be used to match a range, such as `[a-z]`.

!!! failure "Using `**` to recursively match directories at multiple depth levels is not supported."

## `plugins`

The `plugins` section lists plugin dependencies that should be made available to project modules.
Listing a plugin here does not enable it by itself; it only makes it available so that modules can opt in (by enabling
the plugin).

Example:
```yaml
plugins:
  - ./my-plugin
  - ./plugins/my-another-plugin
```

!!! info
    Currently, only dependencies on **local** plugin modules are supported here (the Kotlin Toolchain doesn't support publishing
    plugins yet).
    Entries use the same notation as [module dependencies](../user-guide/dependencies.md#module-dependencies).

To enable and configure a plugin for a specific module, use the `plugins` block in that module:

```yaml title="app/module.yaml"
plugins:
  my-plugin:
    enabled: true
    # plugin-specific settings here
```

# Java annotation processing

To add java annotation processors to your module, add their maven coordinates to the
`settings.java.annotationProcessing.processors` list:

```yaml
settings:
  java:
    annotationProcessing:
      processors:
        - org.mapstruct:mapstruct-processor:1.6.3
```

This option is only available for java or android modules (it's a platform-specific).

As with KSP, it's possible to reference a local Kotlin module as a processor. See the
[KSP section](ksp.md#using-your-own-local-ksp-processor) for more information. Using library catalog entry is also supported.

Some annotation processors can be customized by passing options.
You can pass these options using the `processorOptions` map:

```yaml
settings:
  java:
    annotationProcessing:
      processors:
        - $libs.auto.service # using catalog reference
      processorOptions:
        debug: true
```

  Our philosophy is that you should be able to run your project without manually installing anything on your machine,

# JDK provisioning

The Kotlin Toolchain needs a JDK (Java Development Kit) for various things in your project:

* compile Kotlin and Java sources
* run tests
* run JVM apps
* run a delegated Gradle build for Android bytecode processing
* ...and more

Our philosophy is that you should be able to run your project without manually installing anything on your machine,
setting `JAVA_HOME`, or configuring anything. This is why the Kotlin Toolchain is able to provision a JDK automatically for you.

For many projects, it is important to be able to control the JDK version and sometimes even the distribution.
This page describes how this can be configured.

## Default behavior

By default, the Kotlin Toolchain doesn't constrain the JDK distribution, but it expects a specific major version: **currently 21**.

Since the default [selectionMode](#jdk-selection-mode) is `auto`, the Kotlin Toolchain will look for a JDK 21 in
`JAVA_HOME`, and if not found, will provision one.

## JDK requirements

The Kotlin Toolchain will always use a JDK that matches the requirements you configure in your module file, if it can't, the build
will fail.
Even if nothing is explicitly configured, the Kotlin Toolchain will provision a JDK that matches the default requirements, or fail.

You can currently customize 2 criteria:

* the **major version** (e.g., 11, 21, 25)
* the acceptable **distributions** (e.g., Temurin, Zulu)

Here is how it looks:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
settings:
  jvm:
    jdk:
      version: 21  # major JDK version
      distributions: [temurin, zulu]  # optional allowlist of distributions (accept all if omitted)
```

??? question "Can I use an exact JDK version, like `17.0.2+8`?"

    Yes, but not via the provisioning settings. It is unclear how to reliably work with such a configuration, because
    exact versions/patches differ between vendors and even between OSes for the same vendor.

    If you want to control the exact version, you can use the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to a specific
    JDK, and make sure the JDK requirement settings match this JDK. You can also disable the provisioning by setting
    `settings.jvm.jdk.selectionMode: javaHome` to ensure `JAVA_HOME` is used, and not a fallback. Read below about how
    the JDK discovery works.

??? question "Why a list of distributions?"

    Some vendors don’t publish all versions of their distributions on all platforms.
    Because of this, even if you have a preference for one JDK distribution, you may have to accept another one as
    fallback so that other developers can work on platforms that your preferred JDK doesn't support.

    For example, Amazon Corretto doesn't support Windows ARM64 machines at the moment, so you might want to set a
    fallback to Microsoft's JDK for this case:

    ```yaml
    settings:
      jvm:
        jdk:
          distributions: [corretto, microsoft]
    ```

## JDK selection mode

Based on the requirements we've seen above, the Kotlin Toolchain will make sure that a matching JDK is available for the build.

There are 3 ways it can do this, which you can choose from via `settings.jvm.jdk.selectionMode`:

* `auto` (default): the Kotlin Toolchain will use the JDK from `JAVA_HOME` if it matches the requirements, otherwise it will
  provision a JDK.
* `alwaysProvision`: the Kotlin Toolchain will always provision a JDK, even if `JAVA_HOME` matches the requirements.
  This setting improves the consistency between builds across machines.
* `javaHome`: the Kotlin Toolchain will exclusively use `JAVA_HOME`, and thus fail the build if `JAVA_HOME` does not match the
  requirements. In this mode, auto-provisioning is effectively disabled.

### How requirements are checked

When the Kotlin Toolchain is configured to attempt using `JAVA_HOME`, it reads the `release` file present in all modern JDKs, which
contains the JDK version and vendor. From that file, the Kotlin Toolchain checks that the major version matches the requested one, and
that the vendor is in the allowed `distributions`.

If the `release` file is not present (for instance, in an old JDK), the requirements are considered unsatisfied, and
the consequence depends on the selection mode (in `auto` mode, the Kotlin Toolchain will provision a JDK; in `javaHome` mode, the
build will fail).

## Provisioning mechanism

When the Kotlin Toolchain decides to provision a JDK, it fetches metadata about JDKs, and finds the latest available JDK for the
requested major version on your current OS/architecture, for each of the accepted distributions (if specified).

Among all JDKs found, the Kotlin Toolchain will prefer the distribution that appears first in `settings.jvm.jdk.distributions` or in
the default list. The default list is ordered this way:

- Eclipse Temurin, a.k.a. Adoptium
- Azul Zulu
- Amazon Corretto
- JetBrains Runtime
- Oracle OpenJDK
- Microsoft
- Alibaba Dragonwell
- BellSoft Liberica
- SapMachine
- IBM Semeru Open Edition
- GraalVM Community Edition
- Oracle GraalVM (:warning: requires license)

## Licensing

Some JDK vendors require a commercial license for using some of their distributions in production.
The Kotlin Toolchain will let you know if you're trying to use such a distribution, and won't let you do it by accident.

If you want to use the Kotlin Toolchain with such a distribution, you must make sure you understand the terms of the license, and have
the appropriate contracts or agreements with the vendor.

If you do, acknowledge the license by adding the distribution name to `settings.jvm.jdk.acknowledgedLicenses` (see
examples below).

## Examples

### Specific major version

With the following configuration, the Kotlin Toolchain will use the `JAVA_HOME` JDK if it's any JDK 17.
If not, it will find the latest patch of JDK 17 in the first distribution of the default list, which means it will find
Temurin 17 (at least at the time of writing, when Temurin 17 is still available).

```yaml title="module.yaml"
settings:
  jvm:
    jdk:
      version: 17
      distributions: [temurin, zulu]
```

### Limited distributions

With the following configuration, the Kotlin Toolchain will use the `JAVA_HOME` JDK if it's Amazon Corretto or Microsoft JDK 21.
If not, provision the latest patch of Amazon Corretto 21, or fall back to Microsoft 21 if not found (for example on a
Windows ARM64 machine).

```yaml title="module.yaml"
settings:
  jvm:
    jdk:
      version: 21
      distributions: [corretto, microsoft]
```

### One specific commercial distribution

Require Oracle JDK 21 and acknowledge its license. Find it in `JAVA_HOME` or provision it if `JAVA_HOME` is not
suitable.

```yaml title="module.yaml"
settings:
  jvm:
    jdk:
      version: 21
      distributions: [oracle]
      acknowledgedLicenses: [oracle]
```

### One specific full JDK version

Manually place the specific `21.0.9+7-LTS-338` version of the Oracle JDK in `JAVA_HOME`, and ensures the Kotlin Toolchain uses it:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
settings:
  jvm:
    jdk:
      version: 21
      distributions: [oracle]
      selectionMode: javaHome # (1)!
      acknowledgedLicenses: [oracle] # (2)!
```

1.   Ensures the Kotlin Toolchain never provisions another JDK, just fail if the machine is misconfigured
2.   Tell the Kotlin Toolchain that we know about Oracle's commercial license and accept it

### Ignoring `JAVA_HOME`

Always provision Corretto 21 regardless of JAVA_HOME

```yaml title="module.yaml"
settings:
  jvm:
    jdk:
      version: 21
      distributions: [corretto]
      selectionMode: alwaysProvision
```

# Kotlin compiler plugins

Compiler plugins are a powerful feature of Kotlin that allow extending the language with new features.

## Built-in compiler plugins

JetBrains provides a handful of first-party compiler plugins, and some of them are supported in the Kotlin Toolchain as first-class
citizens. Check the sections below for more information about each plugin.

### All-open

The [All-open](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/all-open-plugin.html) compiler plugin allows you to mark entire groups of
classes as `open` automatically, without having to mark each class with the `open` keyword in your sources.

To enable All-open, add the following configuration to your module file:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    allOpen:
      enabled: true
      annotations: # (1)!
        - org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration
        - org.springframework.stereotype.Service
        - org.springframework.stereotype.Component
        - org.springframework.stereotype.Controller
        - ...
```

1.   Lists the annotations that mark classes as open.

Or you can use one of the preconfigured presets that contain all-open annotations related to specific frameworks:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    allOpen:
      enabled: true
      presets:
        - spring
        - micronaut
```

!!! success "Already covered by the [Spring Boot support](../builtin-tech/spring.md)"

    The All-open plugin is invaluable for Spring projects, because Spring needs to create proxy classes that extend
    the original classes. This is why using `springBoot: enabled` automatically enables the All-open plugin with the
    Spring preset.

### Compose

The Compose compiler plugin is covered in the mode general
[Compose Multiplatform](../builtin-tech/compose-multiplatform.md) section.

### JS Plain Objects

The [JS plain objects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-plain-objects.html) lets you create and copy plain JS objects in
a type-safe way.

To enable this plugin, add the following configuration to your module file:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    jsPlainObjects: enabled
```

Then, simply annotate your `external interface` with `@JsPlainObject`, and you'll be able to use the generated
factory function and copy function.

Read more in the [JS Plain Objects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-plain-objects.html) documentation on the Kotlinlang
website.

### Kotlinx Serialization

The Kotlinx Serialization compiler plugin is covered in the more general
[Kotlinx Serialization](../builtin-tech/kotlinx-serialization.md) section.

### Kotlinx RPC

The Kotlinx RPC compiler plugin is covered in the more general
[Kotlinx RPC](../builtin-tech/kotlinx-rpc.md) section.

### Lombok

The Lombok compiler plugin is covered in the more general [Lombok](../builtin-tech/lombok.md) section.

### No-arg

The [No-arg](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/no-arg-plugin.html) compiler plugin automatically generates a no-arg
constructor for all classes marked with the configured annotations.

To enable [No-arg](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/no-arg-plugin.html), add the following configuration:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    noArg:
      enabled: true
      annotations:
        - jakarta.persistence.Entity
        - ...
```

Or you can use one of the preconfigured presets that contain no-arg annotations related to specific frameworks:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    noArg:
      enabled: true
      presets:
        - jpa
```

### Parcelize

The Parcelize compiler plugin is covered in the [Android](../product-types/android-app.md) section.

### Power Assert

The [Power Assert](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/power-assert.html) compiler plugin enhances the output of failed
assertions with additional information about the values of variables and expressions:

```
Incorrect length
assert(hello.length == world.substring(1, 4).length) { "Incorrect length" }
       |     |      |  |     |               |
       |     |      |  |     |               3
       |     |      |  |     orl
       |     |      |  world!
       |     |      false
       |     5
       Hello
```

To enable Power Assert, add the following configuration:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    powerAssert: enabled
```

By default, Power Assert is enabled for `kotlin.assert` function. You can enable it for other functions as well:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    powerAssert:
      enabled: true
      functions: [ kotlin.test.assertTrue, kotlin.test.assertEquals, kotlin.test.assertNull ]
```

## Third-party compiler plugins

Third-party compiler plugins are Kotlin compiler plugins published by community members.

!!! warning "The IDE support for third-party compiler plugins is best-effort at the moment, see the [Limited IDE support](#limited-ide-support) section below."

### Syntax

To use a third-party compiler plugin, add the following configuration to your module file:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    compilerPlugins:
      - id: org.example.my.plugin
        dependency: org.example:my-plugin:1.0.0
        options:
          myKey1: myValue1
          myKey2: myValue2
```

Where:

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | The ID of this compiler plugin, used to pass options. It is defined by the `pluginId` property in the `CommandLineProcessor` implementation of the plugin. If the plugin is also implemented as a Gradle plugin, its ID can also be found in `getCompilerPluginId()` in the corresponding `KotlinCompilerPluginSupportPlugin` subclass. |
| `dependency` | The compiler plugin dependency, in the form of `groupId:artifactId:version` Maven coordinates, or a catalog reference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `options`    | The options to pass to this compiler plugin, as a key-value map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

??? question "Why do I have to find the plugin ID myself?"

    This is not really meant to be the final way to configure compiler plugins for end users.

    Ideally, compiler plugin authors would write a Kotlin Toolchain plugin that wraps their compiler plugin, so they can do this
    configuration for you (and also provide typed options in their plugin settings).

    At the moment, they can't publish plugins because the Kotlin Toolchain doesn't support plugin publication yet, so this low-level
    API is the only way you, as an end user, can configure compiler plugins.

### Examples

#### Koin

Here is how you could configure the [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) compiler plugin:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    compilerPlugins:
      # The compiler plugin ID is found in the CommandLineInterface implementation of the compiler plugin, but this is
      # actually coming from the build file in this case:
      # https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin-compiler-plugin/blob/75d838fd3ddfabfe34170418573a08fb8766cab8/koin-compiler-plugin/build.gradle.kts#L55
      - id: io.insert-koin.compiler.plugin
        dependency: io.insert-koin:koin-compiler-plugin:0.3.0
```

#### Metro

Here is how you could configure the [Metro](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro) compiler plugin:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    compilerPlugins:
      # The compiler plugin ID is found in the CommandLineInterface implementation of the compiler plugin:
      # https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/blob/b927d128fa57becc83b5ce13621255b96aca12ad/compiler/src/main/kotlin/dev/zacsweers/metro/compiler/MetroCommandLineProcessor.kt#L12
      - id: dev.zacsweers.metro.compiler
        dependency: dev.zacsweers.metro:compiler:0.11.4
        options: #(1)!
          enabled: true
          debug: false
```

1. More options can be found in the
   [MetroOption's source code](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/blob/b927d128fa57becc83b5ce13621255b96aca12ad/compiler/src/main/kotlin/dev/zacsweers/metro/compiler/MetroOptions.kt#L75).

### Limited IDE support

Some compiler plugins generate diagnotics that you want to see in the IDE, or code declarations that you want to use
from your own code. This requires the IDE's embedded compiler to know about the plugin.

Because the Kotlin compiler plugins API is very unstable right now, there is a high chance that the IDE's embedded
compiler is not compatible with the compiler plugins you want to use. This is why we recommend using the
[Kotlin Extended FIR Support (KEFS)](https://github.com/Mr3zee/Kotlin-External-FIR-Support) IDE plugin.

[Install the KEFS IDE plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26480-kotlin-external-fir-support){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

This IDE plugin allows you to teach the IDE how to find the correct version of the compiler plugin for each compiler
version, and thus find the one it needs to use instead of the one used by the CLI (e.g. `./kotlin build`).
You can learn how to configure this plugin in the
[KEFS user guide](https://github.com/Mr3zee/kotlin-external-fir-support/blob/main/GUIDE.md).

!!! warning "Important"

    This requires that the compiler plugin you want to use follows the guidelines described in the
    [KEFS guide for plugin authors](https://github.com/Mr3zee/kotlin-external-fir-support/blob/main/PLUGIN_AUTHORS.md).

---
# Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)

[Kotlin Symbol Processing](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html) is a tool that allows feeding Kotlin source
code to _processors_, which can in turn use this information to generate code, classes, or resources, for instance.
The Kotlin Toolchain provides built-in support for KSP.

Some popular libraries also include a KSP processor to enhance their capabilities, such as
[Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) or
[Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi#codegen).

!!! info

    The Kotlin Toolchain works with KSP2, so any processors used must be compatible with KSP2.
    We’re expecting most processors to make this upgrade soon, as KSP1 is no longer part of KSP releases.
    However, at the moment, you might still see some gaps in support, such as issues with native targets.

To add KSP processors to your module, add their maven coordinates to the `settings.kotlin.ksp.processors` list:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
settings:
  kotlin:
    ksp:
      processors:
        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha12
```

## Multiplatform support

In multiplatform modules, all settings from the `settings` section apply to all platforms by default, including KSP
processors.
If you only want to add KSP processors for a specific platform, use a `settings` block with a
[`@platform` qualifier](../multiplatform.md#platform-qualifier):

```yaml title="module.yaml"
# the Room processor will only process code that compiles to the Android platform
settings@android:
  kotlin:
    ksp:
      processors:
        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha12
```

!!! warning "Generated code is not available in common sources"

    In multiplatform modules, KSP is called for each platform separately. This means that any code generated by KSP
    processors will be available only for the corresponding platform. There is no way at the moment to access the
    generated code from the common fragment (`src`) or intermediate fragments (e.g. `src@native`).

    This limitation comes from the Kotlin compilation model and how KSP aligns with it. Please follow
    [the relevant KSP issue](https://github.com/google/ksp/issues/567) for more information.

## Customizing the KSP version

The Kotlin Toolchain only supports KSP2 (the standalone tool), not the deprecated KSP1 implementation based compiler plugin.

That said, you can use any version of KSP2 as follows:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    ksp:
      version: 2.3.6
```

## Passing options to KSP processors

Some processors can be customized by passing options. You can pass these options using the `processorOptions` section:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    ksp:
      processors:
        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha12
      processorOptions:
        room.schemaLocation: ./schema
```

Consult the documentation of the processor you want to use for more information about the available options.

!!! note

    Note: all options are passed to all processors by KSP. It's the processor's responsibility to use unique option names
    to avoid clashes with other processor options.

## Using your own local KSP processor

You can implement your own processor in a Kotlin module as a regular JVM library, and then use it to process code from
other modules in your project.

Usually, 3 modules are involved:

* The _processor_ module, with the actual processor implementation
* The _annotations_ module (optional), which contains annotations that the processor looks for in the consumer code
* The _consumer_ module, which uses KSP with the custom processor

The annotations module is a very simple JVM library module without any required dependencies (it's just here to provide
some annotations to work with, if necessary):

```yaml title="my-processor-annotations/module.yaml"
product: jvm/lib
```

The processor module is a JVM library with a `compile-only` dependency on KSP facilities, and on the custom annotations
module:

```yaml title="my-processor/module.yaml"
product: jvm/lib

dependencies:
  - ../my-processor-annotations
  - com.google.devtools.ksp:symbol-processing-api:2.0.21-1.0.25: compile-only
```

The consumer module adds a regular dependency on the annotations module, and a reference to the processor module:

```yaml title="my-consumer/module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
  - ../my-processor-annotations # to be able to annotate the consumer code

settings:
  kotlin:
    ksp:
      processors:
        - ../my-processor # path to the module implementing the KSP processor
```

For more information about how to write your own processor, check out
[the KSP documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#create-a-processor-of-your-own).

# Maven-like module layout

The Kotlin Toolchain is opinionated about where to put your sources, resources, and tests (see the
[standard project layout](../basics.md#project-layout)).

When transitioning from other tools, it would be tedious to move all (re)source files around in addition to converting
the build configuration files. To smoothen the transition, the Kotlin Toolchain provides an alternative layout that is compatible with
Maven and Gradle. The layout conforms to the
[Maven Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).

Example:

```
module/
├── module.yaml
└── src/
    ├── main/
    │   ├── java/
    │   │   └── Main.java
    │   ├── kotlin/
    │   │   └── func.kt
    │   └── resources/
    │       └── input.txt
    └── test/
        ├── java/
        │   └── JavaTest.java
        ├── kotlin/
        │   └── KotlinTest.kt
        └── resources/
            └── test-input.txt
```

!!! note

    There is no difference between `java/` and `kotlin/` folders, the Kotlin Toolchain will look for java and kotlin sources in both
    folders. It is only necessary for the sake of transitioning simplicity.

Choosing the file layout is possible per module.

To enable the maven-like module layout, add the following to the `module.yaml` file:

```yaml
layout: maven-like
```

  Apply Maven plugins to your Kotlin project to run tests, generate sources, check code style, produce reports, and more.

# Maven plugins

Maven plugins are tools in the JVM ecosystem that perform tasks during a project's build, such as running tests,
generating source code, checking code style, or producing reports. The Kotlin Toolchain supports integrating Maven plugins into
JVM modules (modules with either `jvm/app` or `jvm/lib` product type).

!!! warning

	Maven plugins are only supported for JVM-only modules.

## Setup

Maven plugins are declared project-wide and then enabled per-module.

First, declare the Maven plugin coordinates in your `project.yaml` under the `mavenPlugins` key.
Each entry uses standard Maven coordinates notation (`groupId:artifactId:version`):

```yaml title="project.yaml"
modules:
  - app

mavenPlugins:
  - org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.5.3
  - org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.6.0
```

Each Maven plugin exposes one or more _goals_ (mojos). A mojo is enabled in the relevant `module.yaml` using the
`pluginArtifactId.goalName` key (`enabled` shortcut):

```yaml title="app/module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

mavenPlugins:
  maven-surefire-plugin.test: enabled
```

Fully qualified form:
```yaml title="app/module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

mavenPlugins:
  maven-surefire-plugin.test:
    enabled: true
```

Setting the value to `enabled` activates the goal with its default configuration.

## Configuration

To customize a goal, replace the `enabled` shorthand with a full configuration block:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

mavenPlugins:
  maven-surefire-plugin.test:
    enabled: true
    configuration:
      includes:
        - "*Smoke*"
```

The keys inside `configuration` directly correspond to the goal's parameters as documented by the respective plugin.
The Kotlin Toolchain reads the plugin's descriptor to resolve parameter types, so IDE completion and validation are available for
supported parameter types.

!!! warning

	Currently, complex parameter types (POJOs) are not supported.

For configuration parameters with `PlexusConfiguration` type, the Kotlin Toolchain supports passing raw XML:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

mavenPlugins:
  maven-enforcer-plugin.enforce:
    enabled: true
    configuration:
      rules: "
        <rules>
          <requireJavaVersion>
            <version>[21,)</version>
          </requireJavaVersion>
        </rules>"
```

### Adding extra plugin dependencies

Some mojos require additional dependencies that are not bundled with the plugin itself. Add them under the
`dependencies` key of the mojo configuration:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

mavenPlugins:
  maven-checkstyle-plugin.checkstyle:
    enabled: true
    dependencies:
      - io.spring.nohttp:nohttp-checkstyle:0.0.11
    configuration:
      configLocation: ./nohttp-checkstyle.xml
      includes: "**/*"
```

# Source generation capability

Maven plugins that generate sources integrate with the Kotlin Toolchain's compilation pipeline automatically.

Example of using a protobuf code generator:

```yaml title="project.yaml"
modules:
  - app

mavenPlugins:
  - io.github.ascopes:protobuf-maven-plugin:2.12.0
```

```yaml title="app/module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
  - com.google.protobuf:protobuf-kotlin:4.33.0

mavenPlugins:
  protobuf-maven-plugin.generate:
    enabled: true
    configuration:
      protocVersion: 4.33.0
      sourceDirectories: [ ./src ]
      kotlinEnabled: true
```

# Executing Maven goals

Each enabled goal becomes a Kotlin Toolchain task named `pluginArtifactId.goal`, scoped to its module.

### Lifecycle integration

Mojo goals with a default Maven phase are automatically wired into the Kotlin Toolchain build lifecycle on a best-effort basis.
For instance, the `generate-sources` phase and respective `protobuf-maven-plugin.generate` task will be run before the Kotlin Toolchain calls the compiler.

!!! warning

	Mojos that do not have a default phase defined are not automatically wired into the Kotlin Toolchain lifecycle.

### Running a mojo explicitly

Use the `task` command with the fully qualified maven mojo goal task name `:moduleName:pluginArtifactId.goal`. For example:

```
./kotlin task :app:maven-surefire-plugin.test
./kotlin task :app:maven-checkstyle-plugin.checkstyle
./kotlin task :app:jacoco-maven-plugin.report
```

# Getting results from Maven Mojo executions

### Output files

All files produced by mojos should be written into a `maven-target/` subdirectory inside the Kotlin Toolchain's build output.
Report mojos (those implementing the Maven reporting API) additionally generate an HTML file under
`maven-target/reports/`. Example output tree:

```
build/
└── maven-target/
    ├── jacoco.exec
    └── reports/
        └── checkstyle.html
```

!!! warning

	Some Maven plugins that do not rely on the Maven project's build directory
	(for example, because they define custom output directories themselves) may produce output elsewhere.
	Please refer to the documentation of those plugins in such cases.

# Known limitations
- **JVM only**: Maven plugins can only be used in JVM platform modules.
- **No general guarantees**: Maven plugin mojos are executed on a best-effort basis,
but some plugins may rely on Maven APIs or capabilities that the Kotlin Toolchain does not support.
- **Single execution per mojo only**: Currently, only a single mojo execution will be performed per Kotlin module.
  There is no support for configuring multiple executions.
- **No Maven extensions**: Maven extensions modify the Maven build lifecycle, which is not suitable for Kotlin projects.
- **No custom dependency resolution**: Plugins that override or extend Maven's dependency resolution mechanism are not supported.
- **No report aggregation**: Currently, the only supported way to produce a report is to run the mojo directly.

  Learn how to use C and Objective-C libraries in your Kotlin Multiplatform modules using cinterop in the Kotlin Toolchain.

# Native interoperability (cinterop)

Kotlin/Native provides the `cinterop` tool to facilitate interaction with C and Objective-C libraries.
The Kotlin Toolchain supports `cinterop` out of the box with zero configuration for the common use case.

## Basic usage

To add a C or Objective-C interop to your multiplatform module:

1. Create a `cinterop` directory in your module root (alongside `src` and `test`).
2. Drop your [`.def` files](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-definition-file.html) into this directory.

The Kotlin Toolchain will automatically detect these files and configure the `cinterop` tool for all applicable native platforms.
**No additional configuration in your `module.yaml` is required**.

## Platform-specific definitions

You can use the [`@<platform>` qualifier](../multiplatform.md#platform-qualifier)
for the `cinterop` directory to limit interop definitions to specific platforms or platform families.

!!! info "At the file level vs. directory level"
    The `.def` file format already supports platform-specific configuration for the library, for example:
    `compilerOpts.linux` vs. `compilerOpts.osx`.

    So it is possible to use a single `.def` file in the common `cinterop` directory
    instead of having separate platform-specific files under, e.g., `cinterop@linux` and `cinterop@macos`.
    Both approaches are currently valid - use the one you prefer.

## Advanced usage

If you need the `.def` file generated or provisioned (for example, to implement custom library location or provisioning logic),
you can write a [plugin](../plugins/overview.md) for this.
See the [relevant docs](../plugins/topics/tasks.md#contributing-back-to-the-build) for more details on how to contribute `cinteropDefinitions`.

# Basic concepts

If you have never used the Kotlin Toolchain before, this is the best place to start. In this section, we will learn about the basic
entities in the Kotlin Toolchain, the general project layout, and how configuration files look.

## Project and modules

A Kotlin **project** is defined by a `project.yaml` file. This file contains the list of modules and the project-wide
configuration. The folder with the `project.yaml` file is the **project root**. Modules can only be located under the
project root (at any depth). If there is only one module in the project, the `project.yaml` file is not required.

A Kotlin **module** is a directory with a `module.yaml` configuration file, and optionally sources and resources.
A *module configuration file* describes _what_ to produce: e.g. a reusable library or a platform-specific application.
Each module describes a single product. Several modules can't share the same sources or resources, but they can depend
on each other.
_How_ to produce the desired product, that is, the build rules, is the responsibility of the Kotlin Toolchain build engine.

## Project layout

### Single-module project

A single-module Kotlin project doesn't need a `project.yaml` file.
Just create a single valid module, and it is also a valid project[^1]:
[^1]: As long as it is not included in a `project.yaml` higher in the directory tree.

```shell title="Single-module project layout"
my-project/ #(1)!
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.kt
├─ test/
│  ╰─ MainTest.kt
╰─ module.yaml
```

1.   This is the project root but also the root of the only module in the project.

See the [Module layout](#module-layout) section for more details about the module structure itself.

### Multi-module project

If there are multiple modules, the `project.yaml` file specifies the list of modules:

<div class="grid" markdown>
<div class="annotate">
```shell title="Multi-module project layout"
├─ app/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ main.kt
│  │  ╰─ ...
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ libs/ #(1)!
│  ├─ lib1/
│  │  ├─ src/
│  │  │  ╰─ myLib1.kt
│  │  ╰─ module.yaml
│  ╰─ lib2/
│     ├─ src/
│     │  ╰─ myLib2.kt
│     ╰─ module.yaml
╰─ project.yaml
```
</div>

1.   This hierarchy is arbitrary, it can be organized however you like. The structure is understood by the Kotlin Toolchain based on
     the list of module paths in `project.yaml` — there is no convention for multi-module projects.

<div class="annotate">
```yaml title="project.yaml"
modules:
  - ./app
  - ./libs/lib1 #(1)!
  - ./libs/lib2
```

```yaml title="app/module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
  - ./libs/lib1
  - ./libs/lib2
```
</div>

1.   It is also possible to use globs to list multiple modules at once (e.g., `./libs/*`), although we encourage
     listing them explicitly. See details in the [project file reference](../reference/project.md#modules).

</div>

See the [Module layout](#module-layout) section for more details about what goes inside each module directory.

??? note "Multi-module project with root module"

    It is also possible to have a root module even if there are multiple modules in the project, although this is
    generally discouraged.

    ```shell
    ├─ lib/
    │  ├─ src/
    │  │  ╰─ util.kt
    │  ╰─ module.yaml
    ├─ src/  # src of the root module
    │  ├─ main.kt
    │  ╰─ ...
    ├─ module.yaml  # the module file of the root module
    ╰─ project.yaml
    ```

    ```yaml title="project.yaml"
    modules:  # The root module is included implicitly
      - ./lib
    ```

## Module layout

Here are typical module structures at a glance:

=== ":intellij-java: JVM"

    --8<-- "includes/module-layouts/jvm-app.md"

    !!! note "Maven compatibility layout for JVM-only modules"

        If you're migrating from Maven, you can also configure the [Maven-like layout](advanced/maven-like-layout.md)

=== ":jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: Kotlin Multiplatform"

    --8<-- "includes/module-layouts/kmp-lib.md"

    !!! info "Read more in the dedicated [Multiplatform modules](multiplatform.md) section."

=== ":android-head-flat: Android app"

    --8<-- "includes/module-layouts/android-app.md"

    !!! info "Read more in the dedicated [Android](product-types/android-app.md) section."

=== ":simple-apple: iOS app"

    --8<-- "includes/module-layouts/ios-app.md"

    !!! info "Read more in the dedicated [iOS](product-types/ios-app.md) section."

All sources and resources are optional: **only the `module.yaml` file is required.**
For example, your module could get all its code from dependencies and have no `src` folder.

Sources and resources can't be defined as part of multiple modules — they must belong to a single module, which other
modules can depend on. This ensures that the IDE always knows how to analyze and refactor the code, as it always has a
single well-defined set of settings and dependencies.

## Module file anatomy

A `module.yaml` file has several main sections: `product`, `dependencies` and `settings`.

!!! question "If you are not familiar with YAML, see [our brief YAML primer](yaml-primer.md)."

A module can produce a single product, such as a reusable library or an application.
Read more on the [supported product types](#product-type) below.

Here are some example module files for different types of modules:

=== ":intellij-java: JVM application"

    ```yaml
    product: jvm/app #(1)!

    dependencies:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-java:2.3.0 #(2)!

    settings: #(3)!
      kotlin:
        version: 2.2.21 #(4)!
        allWarningsAsErrors: true #(5)!
    ```

    1. This short form is equivalent to:
       ```yaml
        product:
          type: jvm/app
       ```
       The `jvm/app` product type means that the module produces a [JVM application](product-types/jvm-app.md).
       Read more about other product types in the [Product types](product-types/index.md) section.
    2. The `dependencies` section contains the list of dependencies for this module.
       Here `io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.3.0` are the
       [Maven coordinates :fontawesome-solid-external-link:](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates) of
       the Ktor client library (with Java engine).
       Read more about dependencies in general in the [Dependencies](dependencies.md) section.
    3. The `settings` section contains the configuration of different toolchains.
    4. An example setting: the Kotlin compiler version used for this module.
    5. An example setting: a compiler setting to consider warnings as errors and fail the build on any warning.

=== ":jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: KMP library"

    ```yaml
    product:
      type: kmp/lib #(1)!
      platforms: [android, iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64] #(2)!

    dependencies:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.3.0 #(3)!

    dependencies@android:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-android:2.3.0 #(4)!

    dependencies@ios:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-darwin:2.3.0 #(5)!

    settings: #(6)!
      kotlin:
        version: 2.2.21 #(7)!
        allWarningsAsErrors: true #(8)!

    settings@ios: #(9)!
      kotlin:
        allWarningsAsErrors: false #(10)!
    ```

    1. The `kmp/lib` product type means that the module produces a [:jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: Kotlin Multiplatform
       library](product-types/kmp-lib.md).
       Read more about other product types in the [Product types](product-types/index.md) section.
    2. The `platforms` list contains the platforms that this module is built for.
    3. The `dependencies` section contains the list of common dependencies for this module.
       Here `io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.3.0` are the
       [Maven coordinates :fontawesome-solid-external-link:](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates) of
       the Ktor client core library.
       Read more about dependencies in general in the [Dependencies](dependencies.md) section.
       Read more about multiplatform dependencies in the [Multiplatform dependencies](multiplatform.md#multiplatform-dependencies) section.
    4. The `dependencies@android` section contains the list of dependencies that are only used when building the module
       for the Android target.
       Here the `io.ktor:ktor-client-android:2.3.0` will not be present when building the module for the iOS targets.
       Read more about dependencies in general in the [Dependencies](dependencies.md) section.
       Read more about multiplatform dependencies in the [Multiplatform dependencies](multiplatform.md#multiplatform-dependencies) section.
    5. The `dependencies@ios` section contains the list of dependencies that are only used when building the module
       for the iOS target.
       Here the `io.ktor:ktor-client-darwin:2.3.0` will not be present when building the module for the Android target.
       Read more about dependencies in general in the [Dependencies](dependencies.md) section.
       Read more about multiplatform dependencies in the [Multiplatform dependencies](multiplatform.md#multiplatform-dependencies) section.
    6. The `settings` section contains the configuration of different toolchains for common code, and also serves as
       default for platform-specific code..
    7. An example setting: the Kotlin compiler version used for this module.
    8. An example setting: a compiler setting to consider warnings as errors and fail the build on any warning.
    9. The `settings@ios` section contains the configuration of different toolchains for iOS-specific compilation.
    10. This setting overrides the one that we set in the `settings` section.
        Read more about this in the [settings propagation](multiplatform.md#multiplatform-settings) section.

### Product type

The **product type** describes what is created when building the module: a JVM application (`jvm/app`), Android
application (`android/app`), Kotlin Multiplatform library (`kmp/lib`), etc.
It actually tells us both the target platform and the type of the module at the same time.

All modules generally work the same way, but each product type may add its own set of rules and capabilities.
Check out the [Product types](product-types/index.md) section and subsections to see details about each of them.

### Dependencies

The `dependencies` section contains the list of dependencies for this module.
They can be external maven libraries, other modules in the project, and more.

See the [Dependencies](dependencies.md) section for more details.

### Settings

The `settings` section contains toolchains settings.
A _toolchain_ is an SDK (Kotlin, Java, Android, iOS) or a simpler tool (linter, code generator).

All toolchain settings are specified in dedicated groups in the `settings` section:
```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.8
  android:
    compileSdk: 31
```

Check out the [Reference](../reference/module.md#settings-and-test-settings) page for the full list of supported settings.

See the [Multiplatform modules](multiplatform.md) section for more details about how multiple settings sections
interact in multiplatform modules.

# :jetbrains-compose-multiplatform: Compose Multiplatform

[Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/) is a declarative UI framework developed by
JetBrains for sharing Kotlin UI code across multiple platforms.

## Enabling Compose

Use `settings.compose.enabled` to enable Compose:

=== ":intellij-java: JVM Desktop"

    ```yaml
    product: jvm/app

    dependencies:
      - $compose.desktop.currentOs # (1)!

    settings:
      compose: enabled # (2)!
    ```

    1.    This library is from the built-in `$compose` catalog, accessible when Compose is enabled
    2.    Enables the Compose toolchain (compiler plugin and runtime dependencies)

=== ":android-head-flat: Android"

    ```yaml
    product: android/app

    dependencies:
      - $compose.foundation # (1)!
      - $compose.material3

    settings:
      compose: enabled # (2)!
    ```

    1.    These libraries are from the built-in `$compose` catalog, accessible when Compose is enabled
    2.    Enables the Compose toolchain (compiler plugin and runtime dependencies)

=== ":jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: Shared library"

    ```yaml
    product:
      type: kmp/lib
      platforms: [ jvm, android, iosSimulatorArm64, iosX64, iosArm64 ]

    dependencies:
      - $compose.foundation: exported # (1)!
      - $compose.material3: exported

    settings:
      compose:
        enabled: true # (2)!
    ```

    1.    These libraries are from the built-in `$compose` catalog, accessible when Compose is enabled. We export them
          to consumers because we use types from these libraries in our own public API.
    2.    Enables the Compose toolchain (compiler plugin and runtime dependencies)

Enabling Compose does the following:

* configures the Compose compiler plugin for the Kotlin compiler
* adds the required `org.jetbrains.compose.runtime:runtime` dependency (implicitly)
* enables the built-in `$compose.*` library catalog for all optional Compose modules

### Custom Compose version

You can specify the exact version of the Compose framework to use this way:

```yaml
settings:
  compose:
    enabled: true
    version: 1.5.10
```

## Using multiplatform resources

The Kotlin Toolchain supports [Compose Multiplatform resources](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-images-resources.html).

Place your resources in the `composeResources` folder at the root of your module:
```
my-kmp-module/
├─ src/
│  ╰─ ... # (1)!
├─ composeResources/
│  ├─ values/
│  │  ╰─ strings.xml
│  ╰─ drawable/
│     ╰─ image.jpg
╰─ module.yaml
```

1.   Your Kotlin code is here

The Kotlin Toolchain then automatically generates the Kotlin accessors for these resources, and you can use them in your Kotlin code:

```kotlin
import my_kmp_module.generated.resources.Res
import my_kmp_module.generated.resources.hello
// other imports

@Composable
private fun displayHelloText() {
    BasicText(stringResource(Res.string.hello))
}
```

Read more about setting up and using compose resources in
[the documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-images-resources.html).

### Generated accessors package

By default, resources accessors are generated in the package `<sanitized-module-name>.generated.resources`, where
`<sanitized-module-name>` is the module name with all non-letter symbols replaced with `_`.

In the above example where the module name is `my-kmp-module`, the package name for the generated resources is
therefore `my_kmp_module.generated.resources`.

You can customize the package name by setting the `settings.compose.resources.packageName` property in your module file:

```yaml
settings:
  compose:
    resources:
      packageName: com.example.gen
```

## :jetbrains-compose-hot-reload: Compose Hot Reload (experimental)

The Kotlin Toolchain supports [Compose Hot Reload](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-hot-reload), allowing you to see UI changes in
real-time without restarting the application. This significantly improves the developer experience by shortening the
feedback loop during UI development.

### Hot-run your application

=== ":jetbrains-intellij-idea: IntelliJ IDEA"

    To run your application with Compose Hot Reload, simply select the *Run with Compose Hot Reload* option from the
    IDE:

    ![Compose Hot Reload special mode of running application](../../images/hot-reload-run-option.png)

    ??? question "I don't have this option, please help!"

        Make sure that:

          * you have installed and enabled the [Kotlin Toolchain IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23076-amper)
          * your module has the `jvm` target (`jvm/app` product type, or a library module with `jvm` platform)

    In this mode, IDEA will recompile and hot-reload your application based on file system changes.

=== ":octicons-terminal-16: CLI"

    To run your application with Compose Hot Reload from the [command line](../../cli/index.md), use the
    `--compose-hot-reload-mode` flag:

    ```shell
    ./kotlin run --compose-hot-reload-mode
    ```

    !!! warning "No file-system watch"

        At the moment, the Kotlin CLI doesn't watch the file system for changes, so the only way to reap the benefits
        of Compose Hot Reload is to run the application from the IDE.

When you run your application with Compose Hot Reload enabled:

- The Kotlin Toolchain automatically downloads and runs [JetBrains Runtime](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime) to maximize
  hot-swap capabilities
- The Java agent for Compose Hot Reload is attached during execution
- A small Compose Hot Reload devtools icon appears next to the application window, indicating that the feature is active

![Compose Hot Reload dev tools](../../images/hot-reload-devtools.png)

### Hot-run specific components

It's also possible to run specific composables in Compose Hot Reload mode instead of your entire application.
This is especially useful to check library components or just individual parts of your apps.

To do that, add the Compose Hot Reload runtime API dependency to your module:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - $compose.hotReload.runtimeApi # for @DevelopmentEntryPoint
```

And add the `@DevelopmentEntryPoint` annotation on any parameter-less `@Composable` function:

```kotlin
@DevelopmentEntryPoint // (1)!
@Composable
fun MySuperComponent() { // (2)!
    MyComponentWithParams(title = "Dummy title", description = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet")
}
```

1.   Makes the component runnable on its own
2.   The component must not have parameters

A clickable gutter icon will appear on the left side of the composable.
![Compose Hot Reload development entry point usage](../../images/hot-reload-deventrypoint-gutter.png)

??? tip "Hot-reloading components with parameters"

    If your component needs parameters, you can create a wrapper component that just creates your component with
    the parameter values you want to use for the hot run, and annotate the wrapper with `@DevelopmentEntryPoint`:

    ```kotlin
    @DevelopmentEntryPoint
    @Composable
    fun MyComponentPreview() {
        MyComponentWithParams(title = "Dummy title", description = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet")
    }

    @Composable
    fun MyComponentWithParams(title: String, description: String) {
        // Your composable code here
    }
    ```

### Custom Compose Hot Reload version

You can optionally customize the version of Compose Hot Reload used by the Kotlin Toolchain this way:

```yaml
settings:
  compose:
    enabled: true
    experimental:
      hotReload:
        version: 1.0.0-rc3
```

# :jetbrains-kotlinx-rpc: Kotlinx RPC

The [kotlinx.rpc](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx-rpc/get-started.html) library allows you to implement Remote
Procedure Calls (RPC) more easily by generating boilerplate code behind the scenes for you.

To enable kotlinx.rpc support, add the following to the `module.yaml` file of each client or server module, and each
module declaring `@Rpc` services:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    rpc: enabled
```

This will automatically:

* enable code generation for your `@Rpc` services via the kotlinx.rpc compiler plugin
* apply the kotlinx.rpc [BOM (Bill of Materials)](../dependencies.md#using-a-maven-bom) to align the versions of the
  RPC-related artifacts
* add some useful [library catalog](../dependencies.md#library-catalogs) entries starting with `$kotlin.rpc.`

# Kotlin Serialization

[Kotlin Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) is the official multiplatform and multi-format
serialization library for Kotlin.

If you need to (de)serialize Kotlin classes to/from JSON, you can enable Kotlin Serialization it in its simplest form:
```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    serialization: json  # JSON or other format
```
This snippet configures the compiler to process `@Serializable` classes, and adds dependencies on the serialization
runtime and JSON format libraries.

You can also customize the version of the Kotlin Serialization libraries using the full form of the configuration:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    serialization:
      format: json
      version: 1.7.3
```

## More control over serialization formats

If you don't need serialization format dependencies or if you need more control over them, you can use the following:
```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    serialization: enabled # configures the compiler and serialization runtime library
```
This snippet on its own only configures the compiler and the serialization runtime library, but doesn't add any format
dependency. However, it adds a built-in catalog with official serialization formats libraries, which you can use in
your `dependencies` section. This is useful in multiple cases:

* if you need a format dependency only in tests:
  ```yaml
  settings:
    kotlin:
      serialization: enabled

  test-dependencies:
    - $kotlin.serialization.json
  ```

* if you need to customize the scope of the format dependencies:
  ```yaml
  settings:
    kotlin:
      serialization: enabled

  dependencies:
    - $kotlin.serialization.json: compile-only
  ```

* if you need to expose format dependencies transitively:
  ```yaml
  settings:
    kotlin:
      serialization: enabled

  dependencies:
    - $kotlin.serialization.json: exported
  ```

* if you need multiple formats:
  ```yaml
  settings:
    kotlin:
      serialization: enabled

  dependencies:
    - $kotlin.serialization.json
    - $kotlin.serialization.protobuf
  ```

[Ktor](https://ktor.io/) is a Kotlin framework for building asynchronous server-side and client-side applications.

To enable Ktor support, add the following to the `module.yaml` file:
```yaml
settings:
  ktor: enabled
```

Setting `ktor: enabled` performs the following actions:

* Applies Ktor BOM
* Contributes Ktor-related entries to a built-in library catalog
* Adds the `io.ktor.development=true` system property when running the app with `kotlin run`

Examples of Ktor projects:

* [ktor-simplest-sample]({{ examples_base_url }}/ktor-simplest-sample)

You can also customize the version of the Ktor libraries using the full form of the configuration:
```yaml
settings:
  ktor:
    enabled: true
    version: 3.3.2
```

If you don't want the Ktor BOM to be applied, you can disable it explicitly:
```yaml
settings:
  ktor:
    enabled: true
    applyBom: false
```

# :spring-boot: Spring Boot

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a framework that simplifies the creation of stand-alone,
Spring based applications.

To enable Spring Boot support, add the following to the `module.yaml` file:
```yaml
settings:
  springBoot: enabled
```

Setting `springBoot: enabled` performs the following actions:

* Applies the [Spring Boot Dependencies BOM](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-dependencies)
* Adds the `spring-boot-starter` dependency
* Adds the `spring-boot-starter-test` test dependency
* Configures `all-open` and `no-arg` Kotlin compiler plugins with the `spring` preset
* Adds the necessary compiler arguments for `kotlinc` and `javac`:
  * For Java, `-parameters` is passed to the compiler to preserve parameter names.
  * For Kotlin, `-java-parameters` is passed to the compiler for the same reason. Also `-Xjsr305` is set to `strict`
    to favor the null-safety annotations.
* Contributes Spring Boot-related entries to the built-in library catalog
* Makes `kotlin run` run with classes instead of JARs (aka the `jvm.runtimeClasspathMode` setting).
  This way the [Spring Dev Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/devtools.html) can provide automatic restarts.

Mixed projects (containing Java and Kotlin sources simultaneously) are supported.

Examples of Spring Boot projects:

* [spring-petclinic]({{ examples_base_url }}/spring-petclinic)
* [spring-petclinic-kotlin]({{ examples_base_url }}/spring-petclinic-kotlin)

You can also customize the version of the Spring Boot libraries using the full form of the configuration:
```yaml
settings:
  springBoot:
    enabled: true
    version: 3.5.7
```

If you don't want the Spring Boot Dependencies BOM to be applied, you can disable it explicitly:
```yaml
settings:
  springBoot:
    enabled: true
    applyBom: false
```

# Dependencies

Dependencies are pieces of code (e.g., libraries or other modules) that your module depends on.

## Declaring dependencies

Dependencies are declared in the `dependencies` list of the `module.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - ./my-other-module #(1)!
  - org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.10.1 #(2)!
  - $libs.apache.commons.lang3 #(3)!
  - $kotlin.reflect #(4)!
```

1. Dependency on another module of the project (see [Module dependencies](#module-dependencies)).
2. Dependency on an external Maven library, with the provided coordinates (see [External Maven dependencies](#external-maven-dependencies)).
3. Dependency on a library from the project's [Library Catalog](#library-catalogs).
4. Dependency on a library from a built-in [Library Catalog](#library-catalogs)
   (in this case, the catalog brought by the Kotlin "toolchain").

### Module dependencies

To depend on another module of your project, use the path to that module, relative to the current module's root
directory. The path must start either with `./` or `../`.

For example, here the `app` module declares a dependency on the `nested-lib` and `ui/utils` modules:

<div class="grid" markdown>
<div>
```yaml hl_lines="4 5" title="app/module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:
- ./nested-lib
- ../ui/utils
```

```yaml title="project.yaml"
modules:
  - app
  - app/nested-lib
  - ui/utils
```
</div>
<div>
``` title="Project structure"
root/
├─ app/
│  ├─ nested-lib/
│  │  ├─ src/
│  │  ╰─ module.yaml
│  ├─ src/
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ ui/
│  ╰─ utils/
│     ├─ src/
│     ╰─ module.yaml
╰─ project.yaml
‎
```
</div>
</div>

!!! note

    Dependencies between modules are only allowed within the project scope.
    That is, they must be listed in the `project.yaml` file and cannot be outside the project root directory.

### External Maven dependencies

Maven dependencies can be added via their coordinates[^1] in the usual `group:artifact:version` notation:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-serialization:1.8.0
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0
```

Maven dependencies are fetched from a Maven repository[^2] before being cached locally.
Default repositories are provided out of the box, so you don't have to configure anything.
If you need to customize the repositories, see [Managing Maven repositories](#managing-maven-repositories).

[^1]: If you're not familiar with Maven coordinates, check out Maven's
[POM reference :fontawesome-solid-external-link:](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates).

[^2]: If you're not familiar with Maven repositories, check out Maven's
[Introduction to repositories :fontawesome-solid-external-link:](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).

### Catalog dependencies

See [Library Catalogs](#library-catalogs).

### Transitivity and scope

#### Scope

The **_scope_** of a dependency defines whether it is available during compilation (_compile classpath_) and/or
available at runtime (_runtime classpath_):

| Scope           |     Compilation      |      Runtime       |
|-----------------|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| `all` (default) |  :white_check_mark:  | :white_check_mark: |
| `compile-only`  |  :white_check_mark:  |        :x:         |
| `runtime-only`  |         :x:          | :white_check_mark: |

By default, the scope is `all`. You can restrict a dependency's scope as follows:

=== "Short form"

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0: compile-only
      - ../ui/utils: runtime-only
    ```

=== "Long form"

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0:
          scope: compile-only
      - ../ui/utils:
          scope: runtime-only
    ```

!!! note

    The long form is necessary when you also need to mark the dependency as `exported`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0:
          exported: true
          scope: compile-only
    ```

#### Transitivity

By default, dependencies of your module are not added to the compilation of dependent modules.
In the following setup, `app` cannot directly use Ktor classes in its code:

<div class="grid" markdown>
```yaml title="lib/module.yaml"
dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0
```

```yaml title="app/module.yaml"
dependencies:
  - ../lib #(1)!
```

1. The `../lib` dependency is added to the compilation and runtime of the `app` module (scope `all` by default). It
   brings the transitive dependency on `ktor-client-core` at runtime, but doesn't expose it at compile time.
</div>

To make a dependency accessible to all dependent modules during their compilation, you need to explicitly mark it as
`exported` (this is equivalent to declaring a dependency using the `api()` configuration in Gradle).

=== "Short form"

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0: exported
      - ../ui/utils: exported
    ```

=== "Long form"

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0:
          exported: true
      - ../ui/utils:
          exported: true
    ```

!!! note

    The long form is necessary when you also need to customize the scope

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0:
          exported: true
          scope: compile-only
    ```

??? info "`exported` is like a scope for transitive consumers"

    We can see `exported` as a way to modify the scope of a transitive dependency in the context of the consuming
    module. For example, say some module named `app` depends on `lib`, which depends on `ktor`. The `ktor` dependency
    is transitively part of the dependencies of `app`.

     * If `lib` doesn't export `ktor`, the `ktor` dependency effectively has a `scope: runtime-only` in `app`
     * If `lib` marks `ktor` as `exported`, the `ktor` dependency effectively has a `scope: all` in `app`

##### When to use `exported`

Ideally, you should use `exported` dependencies as little as possible.
The rule of thumb is that, if your module uses some types from the dependency in its public API, you should mark it as
`exported`. If not, you should probably avoid it.

For example, if you depend on `ktor-client-core` in your module, and you have the following class:

```kotlin
class MyApi(private val client: HttpClient) {
    // ...
}
```

The `HttpClient` type is used in your public constructor, so your consumers will need to see it at compile time.
You should therefore mark `ktor-client-core` as `exported`.

## Library Catalogs

A library catalog associates keys to library coordinates (including the version), and allows adding the same libraries
as dependencies to multiple modules without having to repeat the coordinates or the versions of the libraries.

The Kotlin Toolchain currently supports the following library catalogs:

- one project catalog (user-defined)
- several toolchain catalogs (a.k.a built-in catalogs, such as Kotlin or Compose Multiplatform)

### Project catalog

The **project catalog** is the user-defined catalog for the project.

It is defined in a file named `libs.versions.toml`, and is written in the TOML format[^3] of
[Gradle version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/version_catalogs.html#sec:version-catalog-declaration).
It can be located at the root of the project or at `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (the default from Gradle, to ease
migration).

[^3]: Only `[versions]` and `[libraries]` sections are supported from the Gradle format, not `[bundles]` and `[plugins]`.

!!! info "You can only have one project catalog"

    You can choose between `libs.versions.toml` and `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, but you cannot use both at the same
    time.

To use dependencies from the project catalog, use the syntax `$libs.<key>` instead of the coordinates, where `$libs` is
the catalog name of the project catalog, and `<key>` is defined according to the
[Gradle name mapping rules](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/version_catalogs.html#sec:mapping-aliases-to-accessors).

Example:

```toml title="libs.versions.toml"
[versions]
ktor = "3.3.2"

[libraries]
ktor-client-auth = { module = "io.ktor:ktor-client-auth", version.ref = "ktor" }
ktor-client-cio = { module = "io.ktor:ktor-client-cio", version.ref = "ktor" }
ktor-client-contentNegotiation = { module = "io.ktor:ktor-client-content-negotiation", version.ref = "ktor" }
```

```yaml title="app/module.yaml"
dependencies:
  - $libs.ktor.client.auth
  - $libs.ktor.client.cio
  - $libs.ktor.client.contentNegotiation
```

### Toolchain catalogs

The **toolchain catalogs** are implicitly defined, and contain libraries that relate to the corresponding toolchain.
The name of such a catalog corresponds to the name of the toolchain in the [settings section](basics.md#settings).
All dependencies in such catalogs usually have the same version, which is the toolchain version.

For example, dependencies for the Compose Multiplatform framework are accessible using the `$compose` catalog name, and
take their versions from the `settings.compose.version` setting.

To use dependencies from toolchain catalogs, use the syntax `$<catalog-name>.<key>` instead of the coordinates, for
example:
```yaml
dependencies:
  - $kotlin.reflect      # dependency from the Kotlin catalog
  - $compose.material3   # dependency from the Compose Multiplatform catalog
```

Catalog dependencies can still have a [scope and visibility](#transitivity-and-scope) even when coming from a catalog:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - $compose.foundation: exported
  - $my-catalog.db-engine: runtime-only
```

## Managing Maven repositories

The Kotlin Toolchain needs to fetch Maven dependencies from a Maven repository to use them in your project.
This section describes the default repositories and how to configure more.

### Default repositories

| Name                        | URL                                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Maven Central               | `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2`                         |
| Google                      | `https://maven.google.com`                               |

### Adding repositories

To add more repositories on top of the default ones, add a `repositories` list to your `module.yaml` file:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
repositories:
  - https://repo.spring.io/ui/native/release #(1)!
  - url: https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/ #(2)!
  - id: jitpack #(3)!
    url: https://jitpack.io
```

1. When using just a string, it is used as both the `url` and `id` of the repository.
2. When only the `url` is set, the `id` defaults to the URL. This is equivalent to just using the URL string without the `url:` key.
3. You can use a custom `id` that is different from the URL by specifying the `id:` key explicitly.

### Authentication

Private Maven repositories require authentication.
The Kotlin Toolchain only supports username/password authentication via a `.properties` file at the moment.
You can configure it this way:

<div class="grid" markdown>
```yaml title="module.yaml"
repositories:
  - url: https://repo.company.com
    credentials:
      file: ../local.properties #(1)!
      usernameKey: my.username
      passwordKey: my.password
```

1. The relative path to a `.properties` file containing the repository's credentials

```properties title="local.properties"
my.username=joffrey.bion
my.password=YouWishYouKnewIt
```
</div>

## Using a Maven BOM

To import a BOM, specify its coordinates prefixed by `bom: `

```yaml
dependencies:
  - bom: io.ktor:ktor-bom:2.2.0
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core
```

The effects are the following:

* Maven dependencies that are listed in the BOM no longer need a version (e.g., `io.ktor:ktor-client-core`).
  The version from the BOM is used in this case.
* Dependency versions declared in the BOM participate in version conflict resolution.

!!! tip "This also applies to catalog dependencies!"

    If a dependency in the [library catalog](#library-catalogs) is only used in modules that
    declare a BOM that provides a version for it, then the version can be omitted there:

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    ```yaml title="libs.versions.toml"
    [libraries]
    ktor-client-core = "io.ktor:ktor-client-core"
    ```
    ```yaml title="module.yaml"
    dependencies:
      - bom: io.ktor:ktor-bom:3.2.0
      - $libs.ktor.client.core
    ```
    </div>

# Multiplatform modules

The Kotlin Toolchain was built from the start with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform/kmp-overview.html)
in mind. Kotlin Multiplatform is a technology that allows building a single module for different target platforms.

## Supported platforms

In the diagram below, you'll find all supported platforms.
Some target platforms belong to the same _family_ and share some common APIs.

The following diagram shows the hierarchy between all platform families (intermediate nodes) and platforms (leaf nodes):

``` title="Defaut platforms hierarchy"
common
 ├─ jvm
 ├─ android
 ├─ web
 │   ├─ js
 │   ╰─ wasmJs
 ├─ wasmWasi
 ╰─ native
     ├─ linux
     │   ├─ linuxX64
     │   ╰─ linuxArm64
     ├─ mingw
     │   ╰─ mingwX64
     ├─ apple
     │   ├─ macos
     │   │   ├─ macosX64
     │   │   ╰─ macosArm64
     │   ├─ ios
     │   │   ├─ iosArm64
     │   │   ├─ iosSimulatorArm64
     │   │   ╰─ iosX64
     │   ├─ watchos
     │   │   ├─ watchosArm32
     │   │   ├─ watchosArm64
     │   │   ├─ watchosDeviceArm64
     │   │   ╰─ watchosSimulatorArm64
     │   ╰─ tvos
     │       ├─ tvosArm64
     │       ├─ tvosSimulatorArm64
     │       ╰─ tvosX64
     ╰─ androidNative
         ├─ androidNativeArm32
         ├─ androidNativeArm64
         ├─ androidNativeX64
         ╰─ androidNativeX86
```

!!! warning "The platforms listed here are not all equally supported or tested."

## Choosing target platforms

Not all multiplatform modules support all target platforms. Most modules define a limited subset of the target
platforms. To do so, use the `product.platforms` list:

```yaml
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [iosArm64, android, jvm]
```

??? note "No platform family shortcuts here"
    The `product.platforms` list may only contain _platform_ names, not _platform family_ names.
    This is to ensure the stability of the platforms list when Kotlin is bumped to a higher version.
    Using family shortcuts could change the list of platforms in a very subtle and implicit way.

## Platform qualifier

In multiplatform modules, some source directories and sections in the configuration files can be platform-specific.
The Kotlin Toolchain defines a special suffix, called the `@platform` qualifier, to mark such platform-specific things.

What follows the `@` sign is the name of a _platform_ or _platform family_. The available platforms and platform
families are described in the [Platforms hierarchy](#supported-platforms) section.

We'll see in the next sections how these directories and settings interact.

## Module layout

Here is an overview of what the layout of a multiplatform module looks like when `jvm`, `iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64`,
and `iosX64` platforms are enabled:

--8<-- "includes/module-layouts/kmp-lib.md"

!!! note
    Some other @platform directories were omitted for brevity.

We'll explain what's going on here in the following sections.

### Source dirs

Based on the [platforms hierarchy](#supported-platforms), more common code is visible from more platform-specific code,
but not vice versa:

```
├─ src/
├─ src@native/            # sees declarations from src
├─ src@apple/             # sees declarations from src + src@native
├─ src@ios/               # sees declarations from src + src@native + src@apple
├─ src@iosArm64/          # sees declarations from src + src@native + src@apple + src@ios
├─ src@iosSimulatorArm64/ # sees declarations from src + src@native + src@apple + src@ios
├─ src@jvm/               # sees declarations from src
╰─ module.yaml
```

You can therefore share code between platforms by placing it in a common ancestor in the hierarchy:
code placed in `src@ios` is shared between `iosArm64` and `iosSimulatorArm64`, for instance.

For [Kotlin Multiplatform expect/actual declarations](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-connect-to-apis.html),
put your `expected` declarations into the `src/` folder, and `actual` declarations into the corresponding
`src@<platform>/` folders.

### Resources

The final artifact for each platform gets its resources from `resources` and all `resources@platform` directories that
correspond to this platform of its parent families:

```
├─ resources/          # these resources are copied into the Android and JVM artifact
├─ resources@android/  # these resources are copied into the Android artifact
╰─ resources@jvm/      # these resources are copied into the JVM artifact
```

If different resource directories contain a resource with the same name, the more common resource is overwritten by the
more specific ones.
That is `resources/foo.txt` will be overwritten by `resources@android/foo.txt`.

## Aliases

If the [default hierarchy](#supported-platforms) is not enough, you can define new groups of platforms by giving them
an alias.
You can then use the alias in places where `@platform` suffixes usually appear to share code, settings, or dependencies:

```yaml
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [iosArm64, android, jvm]

aliases:
  - jvmAndAndroid: [jvm, android] # defines a custom alias for this group of platforms

# these dependencies will be visible in jvm and android code
dependencies@jvmAndAndroid:
  - org.lighthousegames:logging:1.3.0

# these dependencies will be visible in jvm code only
dependencies@jvm:
  - org.lighthousegames:logging:1.3.0

# these settings will affect both jvm and android code, and the shared code placed in src@jvmAndAndroid
settings@jvmAndAndroid:
  kotlin:
    freeCompilerArgs: [ -jvm-default=no-compatibility ]
```

```
├─ src/
├─ src@jvmAndAndroid/ # sees declarations from src/
├─ src@jvm/           # sees declarations from src/ and src@jvmAndAndroid/
╰─ src@android/       # sees declarations from src/ and src@jvmAndAndroid/
```

## Multiplatform dependencies

When you use a Kotlin Multiplatform library, its platforms-specific parts are automatically configured for each module platform.

Example:
To add the [KmLogging library](https://github.com/DiamondEdge1/KmLogging) to a multiplatform module, simply write

```yaml
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [android, iosArm64, jvm]

dependencies:
  - com.diamondedge:logging:2.1.0
```

The effective dependency lists are:

```yaml
dependencies@android:
  - com.diamondedge:logging:2.1.0
  - com.diamondedge:logging-android:2.1.0
```
```yaml
dependencies@iosArm64:
  - com.diamondedge:logging:2.1.0
  - com.diamondedge:logging-iosarm64:2.1.0
```
```yaml
dependencies@jvm:
  - com.diamondedge:logging:2.1.0
  - com.diamondedge:logging-jvm:2.1.0
```

For the explicitly specified dependencies in the `@platform`-sections the general
[propagation rules](#dependencysettings-propagation) apply. That is, for the given configuration:

```yaml
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [android, iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64]

dependencies:
  - ../foo
dependencies@ios:
  - ../bar
dependencies@iosArm64:
  - ../baz
```

The effective dependency lists are:

```yaml
dependencies@android:
  ../foo
```
```yaml
dependencies@iosSimulatorArm64:
  ../foo
  ../bar
```
```yaml
dependencies@iosArm64:
  ../foo
  ../bar
  ../baz
```

## Multiplatform settings

All toolchain settings, even platform-specific can be placed in the `settings:` section:
```yaml
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [android, iosArm64]

settings:
  # Kotlin toolchain settings that are used for both platforms
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.8

  # Android-specific settings are used only when building for android
  android:
    compileSdk: 33
```

There are situations when you need to override certain settings for a specific platform only.
You can use `@platform`-qualifier.

Note that certain platform names match the toolchain names, e.g. Android:

- `settings@android` qualifier specifies settings for all Android target platforms
- `settings.android` is an Android toolchain settings

This could lead to confusion in cases like:

```yaml
product: android/app

settings@android:    # settings to be used for Android target platform
  android:           # Android toolchain settings
    compileSdk: 33
  kotlin:        # Kotlin toolchain settings
    languageVersion: 1.8
```

Luckily, there should rarely be a need for such a configuration.
We also plan to address this by linting with conversion to a more readable form:

```yaml
product: android/app

settings:
  android:           # Android toolchain settings
    compileSdk: 33
  kotlin:        # Kotlin toolchain settings
    languageVersion: 1.8
```

For settings with the `@platform`-qualifiers, the [propagation rules](#dependencysettings-propagation) apply.
E.g., for the given configuration:

```yaml
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [android, iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64]

settings:           # common toolchain settings
  kotlin:           # Kotlin toolchain
    languageVersion: 1.8
    freeCompilerArgs: [x]
  android:              # Android toolchain
    compileSdk: 33

settings@android:   # specialization for Android platform
  compose: enabled  # Compose toolchain

settings@ios:       # specialization for all iOS platforms
  kotlin:           # Kotlin toolchain
    languageVersion: 1.9
    freeCompilerArgs: [y]

settings@iosArm64:  # specialization for iOS arm64 platform
  kotlin:           # Kotlin toolchain
    freeCompilerArgs: [z]
```

The effective settings are:

```yaml
settings@android:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.8   # from settings:
    freeCompilerArgs: [x]  # from settings:
  compose: enabled         # from settings@android:
  android:
    compileSdk: 33         # from settings@android:
```
```yaml
settings@iosArm64:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.9      # from settings@ios:
    freeCompilerArgs: [x, y]  # merged from settings: and settings@ios:
```
```yaml
settings@iosSimulatorArm64:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.9      # from settings@ios:
    freeCompilerArgs: [x, y, z]  # merged from settings: and settings@ios: and settings@iosArm64:
```

## Dependency/Settings propagation

Common `dependencies:` and `settings:` are automatically propagated to the platform families and platforms in
`@platform`-sections, using the following rules:

- Scalar values (strings, numbers etc.) are overridden by more specialized `@platform`-sections.
- Mappings and lists are appended.

Think of the rules like adding merging Java/Kotlin Maps.

## Interoperability between languages

Kotlin Multiplatform implies smooth interoperability with platform languages, APIs, and frameworks.
There are three distinct scenarios where such interoperability is needed:

- Consuming: Kotlin code can use APIs from existing platform libraries, e.g. jars on JVM (later CocoaPods on iOS too).
  For Kotlin/Native, you can use raw C and Objective-C libraries via the [cinterop](advanced/native-interop.md) integration.
- Publishing: Kotlin code can be compiled and published as platform libraries to be consumed by the target platform's
  tooling; such as jars on JVM, frameworks on iOS (maybe later .so on linux).
- Joint compilation: Kotlin code be compiled and linked into a final product together with the platform languages, like
  JVM, Objective-C, and Swift.

Joint compilation is already supported for Java and Kotlin, with 2-way interoperability: Java code can reference Kotlin
declarations, and vice versa.
So Java code can be placed alongside Kotlin code in the same source folder that is compiled for JVM/Android:

```
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.kt
├─ src@jvm/
│  ├─ KotlinCode.kt
│  ├─ JavaCode.java
├─ src@android/
│  ├─ KotlinCode.kt
│  ├─ JavaCode.java
├─ src@ios/
│  ╰─ ...
╰─ module.yaml
```

In the future, Kotlin Native will also support joint Kotlin+Swift compilation in the same way,
but this is not the case yet.
At the moment, Kotlin code is first compiled into a single framework per `ios/app` module,
and then Swift is compiled using the Xcode toolchain with a dependency on that framework.
This means that Swift code can reference Kotlin declarations, but Kotlin cannot reference Swift declarations.
See more in the dedicated [Swift support](product-types/ios-app.md#swift-support) section.

# Plugins in the Kotlin Toolchain

!!! tip "Important"
    1. It is a preview, and things are guaranteed to change. Try it out and give us your feedback!
    2. Support for KMP is limited; the current preview is focused on JVM-only projects mostly.
       We may cover KMP scenarios better as the plugin subsystem evolves.

You can read this functionality summary or jump right into the [Quick Start guide](quick-start.md).

## Ideas at the core of the preview

Conceptually, any Kotlin Toolchain plugin consists of two parts:

1. A **configurable** part that is quick to read and fully exempt from arbitrary code execution:
    - `plugin.yaml`
    - `@TaskAction` function signatures, `@Configurable` interfaces, and enums

2. An **executable** part that contains arbitrary task‑action implementation code:
    - Normal code in `src/`, including its dependencies — other local modules and libraries

The *configurable* part is used to quickly and safely build the project model for tooling in a _traceable_ way.
This way we can make **project import safe and nearly transparent** and
provide **user‑friendly, actionable diagnostics** that lead to **precise problem locations** —
for example, why tasks are wired the way they are, or why certain Maven dependencies are added one way or another.
Consequently, this part has limited expressiveness; we are exploring how minimal it can be while remaining useful.

On the other hand, the *executable* part is only needed at build execution time and has no significant restrictions.

## Summary of what is currently extensible

Plugins can currently extend the build with custom build actions — [tasks](topics/tasks.md).
Such tasks can receive [configuration](topics/configuration.md), consume file‑system locations (`Path`s), or produce them.
They can _contribute_ specific typed entities to the build and/or _consume_ them from the build.
Tasks can also serve as [checks](topics/checks.md) and [commands](topics/custom-commands.md).

Task actions can consume:

- [Typed contents](topics/tasks.md#consuming-things-from-the-build) from the build:
    - module sources/resources (via built‑in `ModuleSources` configurable, e.g., `${module.sources}`/`${module.resources}`)
    - module compilation result (via built‑in `CompilationArtifact` configurable, e.g., `${module.jar}`)
    - module runtime/compilation classpath (via built‑in `Classpath` configurable, e.g., `${module.runtimeClasspath}`/`${module.compileClasspath}`)
    - resolve arbitrary Maven dependencies as an ad hoc classpath (via a custom `Classpath` configuration, like `myClasspath: [ "group:name:version", ... ]`)
- arbitrary file trees via specified paths

Task actions can produce:

- [Typed contents](topics/tasks.md#contributing-back-to-the-build):
    - Kotlin/Java sources (via `markOutputAs`)
    - resources (via `markOutputAs`)
- arbitrary file trees in specified paths

For more information on these features, see the KDocs on these built‑in configurable interfaces.

## Missing functionality

### Planned for upcoming releases

- Packaging and publishing plugins
- Bundled module templates in plugins to contribute to the configuration of the modules they are enabled in
- A simpler way of authoring trivial plugins consisting of a single task, template, etc.
- Dependencies between plugins

### We may consider providing solutions for

- Supporting conditionals/loops in the declarative configuration
- Alternatives to YAML as the configuration language

# Quick start

## How to write a plugin

Here we are going to learn how to write a toy build plugin in the Kotlin Toolchain
that exposes some *external* build‑time data to the application by generating sources.

Our plugin should be able to parse a `.properties` file and generate Kotlin properties out of it.
Later we may implement additional features.
We will name our plugin `build-config`.

The sources of the plugin are available in the [amper-plugins-tutorial](https://github.com/JetBrains/amper-plugins-tutorial)
repository on GitHub. You can clone it, checkout the initial revision, and follow the Git log to see the changes made step by step.

### Basic example

Let's start with the following project structure:

<!-- We use python here just to enable annotations -->
```python
<root>/
├─ app/
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ build-config/
│  ├─ src/
│  ├─ module.yaml
│  ╰─ plugin.yaml
├─ utils/
│  ╰─ module.yaml
├─ ... #(1)!
╰─ project.yaml
```

1.    Other project modules

The `project.yaml` looks like this:
```yaml title="project.yaml"
modules:
  - app   #(1)!
  - build-config #(2)!
  - utils #(3)!
  - ...   #(4)!

plugins: #(5)!
  - ./build-config
```

1.    Regular module, e.g., `jvm/app`
2.    Our plugin is also a normal module and needs to be listed here
3.    Regular module, e.g., `jvm/lib` that contains generic utilities useful for most modules in the project
4.    There may be other project modules
5.    This is a block where we list our plugin dependencies to [register](topics/structure.md#registering-plugins-in-the-project) in the project.

And the `build-config/module.yaml` looks like this:
```yaml title="build-config/module.yaml"
product: jvm/amper-plugin
```

This is already a valid (although incomplete) Kotlin Toolchain plugin.

It has a *plugin ID* which defaults to the plugin module name (`build-config`).
The plugin ID is the string used to refer to the plugin throughout the project, e.g., to enable/configure it.

Declaring the plugin in the `plugins` section of `project.yaml` is called _registering_ the plugin, and makes it
available to the project, but it is not yet *enabled in* (applied to) any of its modules.
Learn more about it [here](topics/structure.md#registering-plugins-in-the-project).
But it doesn't contain anything useful yet.

Let's start implementing our plugin by writing a [task action](topics/tasks.md#task-action-definition)
that would do the source generation based on the contents of the properties file.

```kotlin title="build-config/src/generateSources.kt"
package com.example

import org.jetbrains.amper.plugins.*

import java.nio.file.Path
import java.util.*
import kotlin.io.path.*

@TaskAction
@OptIn(ExperimentalPathApi::class)
fun generateSources(
    @Input propertiesFile: Path,
    @Output generatedSourceDir: Path,
) {
    // clean the old state if any is present from the previous invocation
    generatedSourceDir.deleteRecursively()

    val outputFile = generatedSourceDir / "properties.kt"

    if (!propertiesFile.isRegularFile()) {
        error("The file $propertiesFile does not exist")//(1)!
    }
    println("Generating sources")//(2)!

    val properties = propertiesFile.bufferedReader().use { reader ->
        Properties().apply { load(reader) }
    }.toMap()

    // need to ensure the output directory structure exists:
    // the Kotlin Toolchain doesn't pre-create it for us
    outputFile.createParentDirectories()

    val code = buildString {
        appendLine("package com.example.generated")
        appendLine("public object Config {")
        for ((key, value) in properties) {
            appendLine("    const val `$key`: String = \"$value\"")
        }
        appendLine("}")
    }
    outputFile.writeText(code)
}
```

1. Throwing an exception causes the task to fail
2. Simple [logging](topics/tasks.md#logging) (structured logging support comes later)

The code can be written in any Kotlin file in any package – there's no convention here.
`@TaskAction` is a marker for a top-level Kotlin function that can be registered as a task.
`@Input`/`@Output` are marker annotations required for `Path`‑referencing action parameters to tell the Kotlin Toolchain how to treat these paths.

!!! info
    The Kotlin Toolchain automatically uses task [execution avoidance](topics/tasks.md#execution-avoidance) based on the contents of `@Input`/`@Output`-annotated paths.

Declaring a task action does nothing by itself yet.
The task with the action must be _registered_ explicitly to become available in modules the plugin is enabled in.
To do that, we need a special file to register tasks and define how they use the plugin's configuration – `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml title="build-config/plugin.yaml"
tasks:
  generate: # (1)!
    action: !com.example.generateSources
      propertiesFile: ${module.rootDir}/config.properties # (2)!
      generatedSourceDir: ${taskOutputDir}
```

1.    Registers the `generate` task
2.    Specifies the conventional location for the source .properties file

Note that the task action's type is specified using the *type tag* — `!com.example.generateSources` — using the fully qualified function name.

As we see here, the `plugin.yaml` file allows [Kotlin Toolchain references](topics/references.md) with the syntax `${foo.bar.baz}`.
Here we use the built‑in reference‑only property `taskOutputDir` to direct our output to the unique task‑associated output directory that the Kotlin Toolchain provides for us.
And `module.rootDir` is the directory of the module the plugin is enabled in.
Learn more about [Kotlin Toolchain-provided reference-only properties](topics/references.md#reference-only-properties).

But we need to make the Kotlin Toolchain aware that our output is, in fact, generated Kotlin sources,
so the build tool can include them in the compilation, IDE can resolve symbols from them, etc.
To do that, we'll add a `generated.sources` block to our `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml hl_lines="7-10" title="build-config/plugin.yaml"
tasks:
  generate:
    action: !com.example.generateSources
      propertiesFile: ${module.rootDir}/config.properties
      generatedSourceDir: ${taskOutputDir}

generated:
  sources:
    - language: kotlin # (1)!
      directory: ${tasks.generate.action.generatedSourceDir}
```

1.    `java` is also possible here; for resources, use `generated.resources` instead

We've added an entry in `generated.sources` block, where we reference our `generatedSourceDir` path and state
that Kotlin sources will be located there after the task is run.

That's it with the plugin for now! Let's enable it in one of our modules (`app`):

```yaml hl_lines="1-2" title="app/module.yaml"
plugins:
  build-config: enabled # (1)!

# ... Other things, like settings, dependencies, etc.
```

1.    `#!yaml <plugin-id>: enabled` is a shorthand; </br>
      `#!yaml <plugin-id>: { enabled: true }` is the full form

If we now run the build, it will fail with an error from our `generateSources` task:
```
ERROR: Task ':app:generate@build-config' failed: java.lang.IllegalStateException: The file /path/to/project/app/config.properties does not exist
        at com.example.GenerateSourcesKt.generateSources(generateSources.kt:19)
```

That's because we haven't created the `config.properties` file yet, and the code of the task checks for that.
Let's fix it and create the file. As declared in the `plugin.yaml` above, the file is expected in
`${module.rootDir}/config.properties`:

```yaml hl_lines="4" title="build-config/plugin.yaml"
tasks:
  generate:
    action: !com.example.generateSources
      propertiesFile: ${module.rootDir}/config.properties
      generatedSourceDir: ${taskOutputDir}
      # ...the rest is omitted for brevity
```

In our case, it is `<root>/app/config.properties`. Let's create it with the following content:

```properties
APP_NAME=My Cool App
```

If we run the build again, we'll see that our generated `com.example.Config` object is present and is visible in the IDE,
and `"Generating sources"` is being logged to the console.

Now let's explore what else we can enhance about our plugin:

- Let's use a third-party library to generate Kotlin code instead of doing it manually.
- Our plugin should also accept values directly from the user configuration in their `module.yaml`, in addition to taking them from the properties file.
- Let's introduce a toy task that just prints all the generated sources to the stdout.

### Adding library dependencies

We often don't implement a plugin from scratch but rather use the existing tool or a library and wrap around it.
The Kotlin Toolchain plugins, being normal Kotlin modules, can depend on other modules and/or external libraries.
Let's use the `kotlin-poet` library to make our Kotlin code generation more robust and convenient.
In addition to that, let's assume we have a `utils` module in the project.
This module is a collection of some utilities that are used across the project – we'd like to use them in our plugin
implementation as well.

```yaml hl_lines="3-5" title="build-config/module.yaml"
product: jvm/amper-plugin

dependencies:
  - com.squareup:kotlinpoet:2.2.0 # (1)!
  - ../utils # (2)!
```

1.    Plugins support external Maven dependencies.
2.    Plugins support depending on another local module, unless this introduces a dependency cycle, see below.

(For the sake of brevity, we are not going to list the code written with `kotlin‑poet` APIs here,
as the exact code is largely irrelevant in our example.)

??? info "Info: no meta‑build in the Kotlin Toolchain — plugins can depend on regular modules"
    The Kotlin Toolchain doesn't have a notion of a _meta‑build_ (e.g., "included builds"/`buildSrc`, etc.).
    Plugin modules are built inside the same build as the other "production" modules.
    This way, plugins can easily depend on any other project modules (like `utils` in our example),
    as long as there are no physical cyclic dependencies between internal actions.
    !!! success "Example: Self‑documenting"
        A documentation plugin can technically be safely applied to itself (enabled in its own module), because when
        the documentation generation runs, the plugin's code itself can already be built and can be executed in a task
        to generate the docs for itself.
    !!! failure "Example: Can't generate resources for itself"
        If a plugin contributes anything to the compilation, it can't be applied to itself,
        because the cyclic dependency is detected:
        ```
        1. task `generateSources` in module `my-plugin` from plugin `my-plugin` (*)
           ╰───> depends on the compilation of its source code
        2. compilation of module `my-plugin` <───────────────╯
           ╰───> needs sources from ──────────────────╮
        3. source generation for module `my-plugin` <─╯
           ╰───> includes the directory `<project-build-dir>/tasks/_my-plugin_generateSources@my-plugin` generated by
        4. task `generateSources` in module `my-plugin` from plugin `my-plugin` (*) <───────────────────────────────╯
        ```

!!! warning
    Currently, Kotlin Toolchain plugins can't depend on other plugins meaningfully,
    other than to share some implementation pieces.
    This is not recommended anyway – use common utility modules instead.

### Adding plugin settings

Until now, our plugin just used the fixed values/paths, hardcoded within the plugin, with no ability to change them on the module level.
Here we'll describe a way to "parameterize" the plugin, so users can configure its behavior.

Suppose we want the user to be able to:

- customize the properties file name
- provide additional properties values

Let's whip up our public plugin settings definition:
```kotlin title="build-config/src/settings.kt"
package com.example

import org.jetbrains.amper.plugins.Configurable

@Configurable
interface Settings {
   /**
    * Properties file name (without extension)
    * that is located in the module root.
    */
   val propertiesFileName: String get() = "config"

   /**
    * Extra properties to generate in addition to the ones read from the
    * properties file.
    */
   val additionalConfig: Map<String, String> get() = emptyMap()
}
```

!!! tip inline end "Let's be nice and use KDocs!"
    The provided KDocs are going to be visible in the IDE in the tooltips for plugin settings in `module.yaml`.

Such an interface acts like a *YAML schema* to describe the configuration our plugin may receive from the user.
For that we need the `@Configurable`-annotated public interface with the properties of [*configurable* types](topics/configuration.md#configurable-types) and
optional [*default* values](topics/configuration.md#default-values), expressed as *default getter implementations*.

Now we need to tell the Kotlin Toolchain which of our [`@Configurable` declarations](topics/configuration.md#configurable-interfaces)
is the root of the plugin settings that users can configure in their module files.
In our case, it's `com.example.Settings`:
```yaml hl_lines="5-6" title="build-config/module.yaml"
product: jvm/amper-plugin

dependencies: # ...

pluginInfo:
  settingsClass: com.example.Settings
```

!!! tip
    It is good practice to provide reasonable defaults for *all* the plugin settings if possible,
    so the user still can use the plugin right away by simply having written `build-config: enabled`.

This way, we can now configure our plugin in the app's `module.yaml`:
```yaml hl_lines="3-6" title="app/module.yaml"
plugins:
  build-config:
    enabled: true # (1)!
    propertiesFileName: "konfig" # (2)!
    additionalConfig:
      VERSION: "1.0"
```

1.    We still need to enable our plugin explicitly.
2.    Overrides the default "config" value from Kotlin.

!!! warning
    It is not yet possible to use references (`${...}`) in `module.yaml` files or access the module configuration tree from `plugin.yaml`.
    We are planning on supporting this in some quality in the following releases.

But wait! We've added the plugin settings and even used them to customize the plugin behavior.
But we haven't wired them to our task! Let's fix that.

First on the Kotlin side:
```kotlin hl_lines="6" title="build-config/src/generateSources.kt"
// ...
@TaskAction
fun generateSources(
  @Input propertiesFile: Path,
  @Output generatedSourceDir: Path,
  additionalConfig: Map<String, String>, //(1)!
) {
  // ...
  // don't forget to process properties passed via the additionalConfig parameter
  // ...
}
```

1.    `additionalConfig: Map<String, String>` parameter does not require an `@Input` annotation,
      because all "plain data" (no references to `Path` within the type) parameters are already considered as task inputs.

And on the "declarative" side:
```yaml hl_lines="4-6" title="build-config/plugin.yaml"
tasks:
  generate:
    action: !com.example.generateSources
      propertiesFile:
        ${module.rootDir}/${pluginSettings.propertiesFileName}.properties
      additionalConfig: ${pluginSettings.additionalConfig}
      generatedSourceDir: ${taskOutputDir}

generated:
  sources:
    - language: kotlin
      directory: ${tasks.generate.action.generatedSourceDir}
```

`pluginSettings` is a global reference-only property that contains the configured plugin settings for each module the plugin is enabled in.
In our case the type of `pluginSettings` would be `com.example.Settings` which we specified in `pluginInfo.settingsClass`.

So, e.g., when the plugin is enabled in the `app` module in our example when we refer to the `${pluginSettings.propertiesFileName}` in `plugin.yaml`,
we would get the `"konfig"` value the user specified in their `plugins.build-config.propertiesFileName` in `app/module.yaml`

!!! tip
    Remember to rename the file `config.properties` to `konfig.properties`.

### Adding another task

As planned, let's now add another task to the plugin that simply reads the already generated sources and prints them to stdout.

```kotlin title="build-config/src/printSources.kt"
package com.example

// import ...

@TaskAction
fun printSources(
  @Input sourceDir: Path,
) {
  sourceDir.walk().forEach { file ->
    println(file.pathString)
    println(file.readText())
  }
}
```

```yaml hl_lines="7-9" title="build-config/plugin.yaml"
tasks:
  generate:
    action: !com.example.generateSources
      # ...
      generatedSourceDir: ${taskOutputDir}

  print:
    action: !com.example.printSources
      sourceDir: ${generate.action.generatedSourceDir}
```

In the line `sourceDir: ${generate.action.generatedSourceDir}` we reference an `@Output` path of another task.
In addition to automatic execution avoidance for individual tasks, the Kotlin Toolchain automatically infers task dependencies based on matching `@Input` paths with `@Output` paths.
In our example it means that if the task `generate` has a path `/generated/sources` in the `@Output` position, and the task `print` has the *matching* path in the `@Input` position, then `print` will depend on the `generate`.
More on [task dependencies here](topics/tasks.md).

!!! info
    If a task has no declared `@Output`s (like `print` in our example), then no execution avoidance is done for it — it will always run the action.
    This is done because tasks without outputs are almost always introduced for side effects, e.g., diagnostics or deployment.

Now we've added the `print` task, we'd like to use it.
Unlike the `generate` task, it doesn't declare any outputs that are contributed back to the build, so it won't be executed automatically when build/test/run is invoked.
So, to [run](topics/tasks.md#run-a-task) a task manually, one must use the following CLI command:

```shell
./kotlin task :app:print@build-config
```

That's it for this tutorial!
You can study some specific topics about Kotlin Toolchain plugins and/or go try to write one yourself.

# Checks

Checks are tasks that validate your application or the code base and report any issues found.

## Running checks

To run checks, one can use the `check` command. If no arguments are provided, the command will launch all the tests
(similar to the `test` command) and all the checks registered in the plugins.

To run only a subset of checks, pass them as arguments to the `check` command:

```shell
$ ./kotlin check detekt apiCheck
```

!!! note
    To get the name of the checks available in the project run `./kotlin show checks`.

If you want to run all the checks except some, you can use the `--skip` option:

```shell
$ ./kotlin check --skip tests  # Will run all the checks except the built-in 'tests' checker
```

It is also possible to run checks only for some modules by passing the module name in the `--module` option (can be repeated):

```shell
$ ./kotlin check --module api --module core  # Will only run checks in the 'api' and 'core' modules
# or
$ ./kotlin check -m api -m core
```

## Create checks

To create a check, you need to [write a task](tasks.md) and register it as a check.

To register a task as a check, add it to the `checks` section of the `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml title="plugin.yaml"
tasks:
  lint:
    action: !kotlinJavaLint
      sources: ${module.kotlinJavaSources}

checks:
  - lint  # Can be called via `./kotlin check lint`

  # You can customize the name of the check using the full form
  - name: myLint  # Can be called via `./kotlin check myLint`
    performedBy: lint
```

!!! note
    To fail a check, the underlying task should throw an exception during the task execution.

# Configuration

This section provides details on how to configure tasks and plugin settings, how the schema works, default values and more.

!!! question "YAML?"
    The Kotlin Toolchain currently uses "Kotlin Toolchain-flavored" YAML as the configuration language.
    YAML is flexible, and it allowed us to move fast with prototyping solutions, plugins included.
    However, we are aware of YAML's shortcomings and are exploring the possibility of replacing YAML with a custom
    language tailored for our needs in the future.

## Configurable types

**Configurable types** are types that the Kotlin Toolchain allows in plugin and task configurations.
Their values are set in YAML configurations, and used in Kotlin _task actions_.

The following table lists the configurable types and their Kotlin and YAML representations:

| Configurable type             | Kotlin type                         | YAML structure                          |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `string`                      | `kotlin.String`                     | scalar                                  |
| `boolean` (`true` \| `false`) | `kotlin.Boolean`                    | scalar                                  |
| `integer`                     | `kotlin.Int`                        | scalar                                  |
| `path`                        | `java.nio.file.Path`                | scalar                                  |
| `enum E`                      | `enum class E`                      | scalar                                  |
| `sequence [T]`                | `kotlin.collections.List<T>`        | sequence                                |
| `mapping {string : T}`        | `kotlin.collections.Map<String, T>` | mapping/sequence of pairs               |
| `object T`                    | `@Configurable interface T`         | mapping + [others](#shorthand-notation) |
| `T` \| `null`                 | `T?`                                | "null" scalar                           |

Task action parameters and properties in `@Configurable` interfaces are only allowed to be of _configurable_ types.

!!! note
    Currently, any custom configurable type — for example, a `@Configurable` interface or an enum —
    defined in plugin `A` cannot be reused in plugin `B`, even if the module of plugin `A` has module `B` as its dependency.
    The tool will issue an "Unexpected schema type" diagnostic.
    This restriction may be lifted in the future.

There are also built‑in [variant types](#variant-types), but the mechanism is not yet allowed in user code.

## Configurable interfaces

A configurable interface is a public Kotlin interface annotated with the `@Configurable` annotation.
The following restrictions apply to this interface:

- methods, superinterfaces, generics are not allowed
- it may only have read-only non-extension (`#!kotlin val`) properties
- all its properties must be of a _configurable type_ themselves
- its properties may have a default getter implementation, depending on their type.
  See the [Default values](#default-values) section.

```kotlin title="Valid configurable declarations"
@Configurable
interface MySettings {
    /**
    * Note: KDocs on configurable entities are visible to the tooling
    */
    val booleanSetting: Boolean
    val intSetting: Int
    val stringSetting: String
    val nested: Nested
    val pathSetting: Path
    val mapSetting: Map<String, String>
    val listSetting: List<Nested>
}

@Configurable
interface Nested {
    val enumSetting: MyEnum
    val nullableStringSetting: String?
}

enum class MyEnum { Hello, Bye }
```

### Plugin settings

A `@Configurable` interface may be specified in a plugin's `module.yaml` to expose it as user‑facing plugin settings:
```yaml title="module.yaml"
pluginInfo:
  settingsClass: com.example.MyPluginSettings
```

The property with the name `enabled` is reserved in such interfaces.

Then the object with this type (e.g., `com.example.MyPluginSettings | null`) becomes available under `plugins.<plugin-id>`
in every module in the project.
An additional synthetic boolean `enabled` [shorthand](#shorthand-notation) property is present in the object to control
if the plugin is enabled in the module or not.

## Enums

Generally, any enum is allowed in the configuration. You may want to specify custom names for the enum constants to be
used in configuration, using the `#!kotlin @EnumValue` annotation.
Otherwise, the `name` of the entry is used in the configuration.

=== "Kotlin"
    ```kotlin
    enum class MyEnum {
        Hello,
        @EnumValue("byeBye")
        Bye,
    }
    ```
=== "YAML"
    ```yaml
    myEnum1: Hello
    myEnum2: byeBye
    ```

## Default values

Properties and task action parameters are allowed to have default values specified in Kotlin.

Properties use _default getter implementation_ syntax. The getter must have an _expression body_:

```kotlin
@Configurable interface Settings {
    val myBoolean get() = false
    val myString get() = "default"
}
```

Task parameters use the regular default value syntax:

```kotlin
@TaskAction fun myAction(
    myBoolean = false,
    myString = "default",
) { /*...*/ }
```

| Configurable type              | Supported explicit default values                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `string`, `boolean`, `integer` | Kotlin constant expression of the appropriate type    |
| `enum E`                       | enum constant references, e.g., `E.Constant`          |
| `path`                         | not supported yet                                     |
| `sequence [T]`                 | `emptyList()`                                         |
| `mapping {string : T}`         | `emptyMap()`                                          |
| `T` \| `null`                  | `null` (not required - implicit default)              |
| `object T`                     | not supported (instantiated implicitly, see the note) |

!!! note "Defaults for properties of object types"
    Properties of an object type can't have an explicit default value.
    Instead, all objects are instantiated using the default values of their properties.
    If the object type has any properties without defaults itself, then it is **not** instantiated by default.

    !!! example "Example - SomeSettings"
        ```kotlin
        @Configurable interface SomeSettings {
            val foo: Foo  // has default - `Foo` can be instantiated by default
            val bar: Bar  // no default - `Bar` has required properties
        }

        @Configurable interface Foo {
            val quu1: String get() = "hello"  // (has default - optional in YAML)
        }

        @Configurable interface Bar {
            val quu2: String  // (no default - required in YAML)
        }
        ```

## Advanced

!!! info
    Although these features are present in the typing/configuration system and are used in some built‑in APIs,
    they are **not yet ready** to be used by plugin authors in their own Kotlin code.

You may read the following sections at your leisure if you seek to better understand
how dependency notation, task actions or "short forms" work in the Kotlin Toolchain.

### Shorthand notation

Some built‑in `@Configurable` interfaces, e.g., `Classpath`, allow the "shorthand" notation.
They have a property marked with the `#!kotlin @Shorthand` internal annotation.
This enables objects of the type to be constructed in a "short" form: not from the YAML mapping, but from the
value of the type that the shorthand property has. Other properties are then set to their default values.

For example, `#!yaml classpath: [ "foo:bar:1.0" ]` is a short form of
```yaml
classpath:
  dependencies: [ "foo:bar:1.0" ]
```
because the `dependencies` property is marked as a "shorthand".

!!! warning
    Shorthands do not currently work with references.
    E.g., if there's a property `foo` of the `sequence[Dependency]` type,
    then `#!yaml classpath: ${foo}` will not work. So, the expanded form `#!yaml classpath: { dependencies: ${foo} }` is
    required.

The special case for the shorthand notation is when the shorthand property is a boolean.
Then, instead of the `true` keyword, one needs to write the property name itself, e.g., `enabled`.
For example, [plugin settings](#plugin-settings) have an implicit synthetic `enabled` property which is a shorthand.

### Variant types

On the Kotlin side, they are modeled as a `@Configurable` `sealed` interface.
When a variant type is expected, there is a need to express which exact variant is being provided in the configuration.
This ability to express the exact type is not yet designed in the Kotlin Toolchain and generally looks unintuitive in YAML.

An example of variant type is the built‑in `Dependency` type, which can be a local module dependency (`Dependency.Local`)
or an external Maven dependency (`Dependency.Maven`). Each of these subtypes has a `@DependencyNotation`-annotated property.

The discrimination between the subtypes is done based on the value of that property:

- if the value starts with a `.`, it is read as a local module dependency
- otherwise, it is read as a Maven dependency

#### Task action types

Technically, task's `action` property also has a variant type.
This type is synthetic, and its variants are also synthetic types
that are based on all the signatures of all the `@TaskAction` functions in the plugin,
so all the task parameters become properties with the correspodning types.
And in this case an **explicit YAML type tag** is required to communicate the exact type.

# Custom commands

Custom commands are tasks that perform side effects extending the build capabilities. E.g., such tasks can print a report to the console,
update the linter baseline, upload artifacts to a custom repository, etc.

## Running custom commands

To run a command, one can use the `do` command followed by the command name.

```shell
$ ./kotlin do updateDetektBaseline
```

!!! note
    To get the name of the commands available in the project run `./kotlin show commands`.

It is also possible to run commands only for some modules by passing the module name in the `--module` option (can be repeated):

```shell
$ ./kotlin do updateDetektBaseline --module api --module core  # Will update baseline only for the 'api' and 'core' modules
# or
$ ./kotlin do updateDetektBaseline -m api -m core
```

## Create custom commands

To create a custom command, you need to [write a task](tasks.md) and register it as a command.

To register a task as a custom command, add it to the `commands` section of the `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml title="plugin.yaml"
tasks:
  updateBaseline:
    action: !runDetektForBaseline
      sources: ${module.kotlinJavaSources}
      outputFile: ${module.rootDir}/detekt/baseline.xml

commands:
  - updateBaseline  # Can be called via `./kotlin do updateBaseline`

  # You can customize the name of the command using the full form
  - name: updateDetektBaseline  # Can be called via `./kotlin do updateDetektBaseline`
    performedBy: updateBaseline
```

# References

The Kotlin Toolchain uses its own value‑reference system using the `${...}` syntax.
Throughout the documentation this syntax is referred to as **Kotlin Toolchain references** or simply **references**.
Currently, its usage is limited to plugin configuration files (`plugin.yaml`).

!!! info
    Standard YAML anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) are not supported in the Kotlin Toolchain.

## Syntax

References are specified using the `${...}` syntax.
Inside the braces a **property path** is specified — one or more dot‑separated reference parts, e.g., `${start.one.two.three}`

### String interpolation

One or more references can be embedded in YAML scalar values using **string interpolation**.
This works for properties that expect either `string` or `path` types.

- For strings: `prefix-${some.name}-suffix`
- For paths: `base/${something.dir}/${file.name}.name`

References pointing to values of `string`, `path`, `integer`, or `enum` can be used in string interpolation.

!!! note
    References inside mapping keys are not yet allowed.
    So constructions like this are not permitted:
    ```yaml
    myMap:
      ${module.name}: "value"
    ```

## Reference resolution

Assume we have a reference `${foo.bar.baz}`:

- `foo` is the _starting part_
- `bar` and `baz` are the remaining parts

Reference resolution is done relative to the location of the reference in the value tree.

1. The _starting part_ is resolved, i.e., the _property_ with the name matching the _starting part_ is found,
   **searching upward in the _lexical scopes_**.
2. The remaining parts are resolved consequently as member-properties against the starting value.

The _lexical scope_ consists of all property names in the given YAML mapping, including names that are implicitly present there.
Such implicit properties are:

- properties that are not specified explicitly but have [default values](configuration.md#default-values)
- [reference-only](#reference-only-properties) properties

!!! example "Example: how scopes are defined"
    ```yaml
    sibling-object:
      foo: 1
      bar: 4 # scopes here: (1)
    object:
      # foo: 1 (by default)
      # provided: 2 (reference-only)
      list:
        - quu: 'a'
          buu: 'b' # scopes here: (2)
      baz: 3
      bar: 4 # scopes here: (3)
    ```

    1.    (in the order of the lookup):

          1. `{foo, bar}`
          2. `{sibling-object, object}`

    2.    (in the order of the lookup):

          1. `{quu, buu}`
          2. `{foo, provided, list, baz, bar}`
          3. `{sibling-object, object}`

    3.    (in the order of the lookup):

          1. `{foo, provided, list, baz, bar}`
          2. `{sibling-object, object}`

Cyclic references are not allowed!
This includes references that ultimately point to each other or to a direct sub- or super-tree of each other.

!!! info
    There is no way to refer to the list element (using indexes or otherwise).
    So `${myList.0.foo}` is not possible.

!!! info
    Not every built‑in property in `plugin.yaml` can be referenced (be the final value that a reference resolves to).
    Some properties are there purely as configuration DSL/skeleton/sections, e.g., the `generated` block or the `tasks` map.
    Referencing these things directly makes no sense and is forbidden.
    They can, however, appear as the starting/intermediate reference part, e.g., `tasks.myTask.action.myInput`.

### Type compatibility

The resolved value's type must be assignable to the property's type:

- `null` values are assignable to nullable (`| null`) types.
- `string`, `path`, `integer`, and `enum` values are assignable to `string` properties.

## Reference-only properties

The properties below are available for referencing in `plugin.yaml` and are read‑only.
Their values are provided by the Kotlin Toolchain itself, and they are designed to provide the plugin author
with the necessary information to configure the plugin logic.

### Global

These properties are available in the root scope:

```yaml
# module: { ... }
# pluginSettings: { ... }

tasks:
  myTask: {...}
```

| Property path              | Type                                                          | Description                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pluginSettings`           | the type specified in `pluginInfo.settingsClass`              | The plugin’s settings object from the `plugins.<plugin-id>` block of the module the plugin is enabled in.             |
| `module.name`              | `string`                                                      | Module display name.                                                                                                  |
| `module.rootDir`           | `path`                                                        | Absolute path to the module root (where `module.yaml` is).                                                            |
| `module.runtimeClasspath`  | `Classpath`                                                   | Resolved runtime classpath (JVM, main).                                                                               |
| `module.compileClasspath`  | `Classpath`                                                   | Compile classpath plus the module’s compilation result.                                                               |
| `module.kotlinJavaSources` | `ModuleSources`                                               | Kotlin and Java sources (JVM, main).                                                                                  |
| `module.resources`         | `ModuleSources`                                               | Resources (JVM, main).                                                                                                |
| `module.jar`               | `CompilationArtifact`                                         | Compiled JAR (JVM, main).                                                                                             |
| `module.self`              | `Dependency.Local`                                            | A dependency pointing to the module itself                                                                            |
| `module.settings.**`       | depends on the actual setting type: `string`, `boolean`, etc. | The settings of the module where the plugin is enabled. For example, `module.settings.publishing.version`.            |
| `project.rootDir`          | `path`                                                        | Absolute path to the project root where `project.yaml` (or `module.yaml`) is for multi- (or single-) module projects. |

!!! note
    * `pluginSettings` is defined only if a plugin has a [settings class](configuration.md#plugin-settings).
    * In a multiplatform module, `module.settings.**` provides access only to the `common` settings. Platform qualifiers, such as `@jvm`, are not yet visible to plugins.

### Task-scoped

These properties are available in the lexical scope for every task:

```yaml
tasks:
  myTask:
    # taskOutputDir
    action: {...}
```

| Property path    | Type   | Description                                   |
|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `taskOutputDir`  | `path` | Unique output directory for the given task.   |

!!! warning
    Sometimes a user‑defined property may clash with another one or with a reference‑only one.
    For example:
    ```yaml
    action: !myAction
      module: ${module.name}
    ```
    As the lookup of the starting part happens upwards rather than from the root,
    this will lead to a cyclic‑reference error.
    So instead of the reference-only `module` from the root scope the resolution will find the `module` property in the current scope.
    These reference resolution shortcomings are known;
    for now, avoid name clashes to prevent such situations.

# Plugin structure

A plugin is a standard Kotlin module with the `jvm/amper-plugin` product type.
It has a regular `module.yaml` build file with an additional [`pluginInfo` section](../../../reference/module.md#plugininfo).

In addition, a plugin has a `plugin.yaml` file, where [tasks](tasks.md) are registered and configured.

The implementation of the tasks (the plugin's logic) is written in Kotlin in the `src` directory.

??? question "Planned: simple cases – simpler structure"
    There can be simpler cases for custom build logic for which having a full-blown plugin may be overkill.
    For example, a single ad-hoc task action that is only needed in one module.

    We are planning to improve UX for such cases and provide a more laconic way to express them.

Each plugin has an **ID**, which defaults to its module name.
The **plugin ID** is used across the project to refer to the plugin, e.g., when enabling it or in diagnostic messages.

??? info "The plugin ID can be customized"
    For example:
    ```yaml title="build-config/module.yaml"
    pluginInfo:
      id: "build-konfig"
    ```
    This changes the ID from the default `build-config` to `build-konfig`.

    :warning: Changing the default ID makes little sense if we are not sharing the plugin between projects, which is not supported yet.
    Currently, the ID string doesn't have a well-defined format, so leaving the ID at its default is a good idea.

## Registering plugins in the project

Kotlin Toolchain plugins are module-level plugins – they are enabled per module.
There is no such concept as a project-wide plugin in the Kotlin Toolchain.

To make a plugin available in the project, it must be _registered_ by listing
the dependency on it in the [`plugins` section](../../../reference/project.md#plugins) of the `project.yaml` file:
```yaml
modules:
  - ...
  - plugins/my-plugin

plugins:
  - ./plugins/my-plugin
```

Registered plugins are not yet _enabled_ anywhere.
One must enable them manually in each module where they are needed.

There may be cases where a plugin is developed as part of the project, but not needed _in the project itself_.
Then such a plugin is present in the `modules` list, but not included in the `plugins` list.

??? note "Similar to `apply false` in Gradle..."
    The Kotlin Toolchain's approach to registering plugins project-wide and enabling them per-module is somewhat similar to the
    recommended approach in Gradle. There one lists plugins at the project level with the `apply false` clause and
    then enables them where needed.

## Enabling plugins

Plugins can be enabled and [configured](configuration.md#plugin-settings) like this:

=== "module.yaml (shorthand)"

    Just to enable the plugin and leave the default configuration:
    ```yaml
    plugins:
      <plugin-id>: enabled
    ```

=== "module.yaml (expanded)"

    To enable the plugin and configure the plugin settings:
    ```yaml
    plugins:
      <plugin-id>:
        enabled: true
        # other options
    ```

!!! tip
    If many modules use the same plugin, potentially even using some common settings for it,
    then it may make sense to use a dedicated [module template](../../templates.md)
    that enables and configures the plugin.

# Tasks

## Task action definition

Task actions are top-level Kotlin functions annotated with `@TaskAction`.
Restrictions for a task action function:

- must be a top-level, public function
- must return `Unit`
- must not be an extension, generic, `suspend`, `inline`, or have context parameters
- parameter types must be [configurable types](configuration.md#configurable-types)

Parameters are allowed to have default values as per [configurable defaults](configuration.md#default-values).

### Path parameters

Parameters of type `Path` require an explicit role:

- `@Input` if the path points to files/directories read by the action
- `@Output` if the path points to files/directories written by the action

The requirement applies transitively: if a parameter’s type contains a `Path` anywhere inside,
the parameter must still be marked with either `@Input` or `@Output`,
so the build tool knows their semantics.

!!! example
    Examples of types that require the parameters to be annotated with input/output marker:

    - `List<Path>`
    - `Map<String, Path>`
    - `Distribution`, defined as:
      ```kotlin
      @Configurable interface Distribution {
        val manifestPath: Path
        val binaryPath: Path
      }
      ```
    - built‑in configurable interfaces that request files, e.g., `ModuleSources`, `Classpath`, etc.

!!! info
    Special built‑in configurable interfaces that are used to request _files_ from the build — such as `ModuleSources`, `Classpath`, or `CompilationArtifact` —
    are **always required to be annotated with `@Input`**.

All non‑`Path`‑referencing parameters are considered **inputs** and do not require any additional annotations.

## Tasks runtime

Tasks are executed inside an isolated JVM environment, and no guarantees are made about the state of static globals from
one task action invocation to the other.

At the moment tasks are effectively executed inside the Kotlin Toolchain JVM using an isolated plugin classloader
that contains only the plugin's runtime classpath.
This concrete implementation is very much likely to change in the future, so it is advised not to rely on it.

### Runtime API

There is no currently available runtime API exposed for tasks, besides the configuration system.
So plugin authors are free to use whatever libraries they need to implement things.
In the future some runtime APIs that the Kotlin Toolchain can provide and support will be added.

#### Logging

Use `System.out/err`, the Kotlin Toolchain will associate the output with the task name in its build log.
Structured logging support is coming soon.

## Execution avoidance

The Kotlin Toolchain uses a built‑in execution‑avoidance mechanism for task actions by default.
When not disabled, the Kotlin Toolchain decides whether to rerun an action based on:

- the action execution classpath changes (if the action code is recompiled, tasks using the action need to be rerun)
- effective values of the action arguments that are non‑paths, including property values of configurable interfaces, recursively
- the state of all gathered file-tree inputs and file-tree outputs declared via `@Input`/`@Output`

!!! note
    Currently, only file attributes and modification time are inspected to compute if a file tree changed.
    No file content checking is performed.

This behavior is controlled per action by the `executionAvoidance` parameter of `@TaskAction` annotation:

- `ExecutionAvoidance.Automatic` (default) — compute up‑to‑dateness as described above. If a task action declares no outputs, it always re‑runs.
- `ExecutionAvoidance.Disabled` — always re‑run the action regardless of inputs/outputs.
   Use this if the task has side effects and/or its up‑to‑date state needs to be computed in a more complex way.

!!! tip
    When implementing the desired build logic as task actions, keep the execution avoidance in mind. For example, for
    a deployment plugin that builds and publishes a distribution, it is better to have two separate tasks: `build` and `publish`.
    The `build` task can be "incremental" and benefit from automatic execution avoidance because it's easy to declare its inputs and outputs;
    while `publish` task has undeclarable side effects and cannot be incremental at the build system level.

## Task Dependencies

Dependencies between user‑registered tasks are inferred automatically from matching `@Input` and `@Output` paths in their actions:

- If task A declares an `@Output` path and task B declares an `@Input` path that _matches_ it, the Kotlin Toolchain adds a dependency from B to A.
- Paths are considered _matching_ when they are either equal or one is an ancestor or descendant of the other.
  For example:

    - `/foo/bar` and `/foo/bar/out.txt` are matching
    - `/foo/bar` and `/foo/baz` are not matching

!!! info
    If an `@Input` points inside the build directory but no task produces a matching `@Output`, a warning is issued to help catch misconfigured paths.

There is no way to specify task dependencies **manually** for now.

### Disabling dependency inference for a particular input

Use `@Input(inferTaskDependency = false)` on a path parameter when you do not want a dependency to be inferred, even if another task writes to the same path.

!!! example
    This is needed for “baseline” files where an “update” task writes the baseline and a “check” task reads and compares it.
    If a dependency were inferred, “update” would always run before “check”, hiding problems.

    A good example of this case could be seen in the [Binary Compatibility Validator]({{ repo_filetree_url }}/build-sources/binary-compatibility-validator/plugin.yaml).

!!! note
    Disabling dependency inference on an input with `@Input(inferTaskDependency = false)` only affects task wiring.
    The file(s) pointed to by that input are still considered for execution‑avoidance decisions.

## Task Registration

Tasks are registered declaratively in the plugin’s `plugin.yaml` under the `tasks` map.
Each entry creates a task instance with a short name (the map key):

```yaml
tasks:
  myTaskName:
    action: !fully.qualified.function.name
      param1: ...
      param2: ...
```

The task action is specified using the `action` property.
This property requires an explicit YAML type tag, in this example `!fully.qualified.function.name`, to express
which exact action the task uses.
The tag starts with the bang (`!`) and then goes the fully qualified name of the Kotlin `@TaskAction` function.
There is a [note](configuration.md#task-action-types) on how this works on the configuration level.

The properties of the `action` object correspond to parameters of the Kotlin function.

The same task action can be registered multiple times under different task names and with different argument values.
Tasks are registered once in `plugin.yaml`, but they are instantiated per module where the plugin is enabled.

??? question "Why does the concept of a task feel split between Kotlin and YAML?"
    As we want to provide the best tooling and IDE assistance, we want the most information available "declaratively"
    so it can be easily traced and made available quickly and safely.

    The build tool still needs to preprocess Kotlin code to extract task signatures and configurable types.
    So we want to have the least amount of information in Kotlin, mostly only implementation.

    Custom task actions can be reused multiple times in different tasks.
    Also, there can be shared/built‑in universal task actions like `copy`, `download`, `unzip`, etc.

    So registering a new task can be as easy as dropping a few lines of YAML (for now) and reusing the ready task action.

    Now, inputs/outputs markup is done in Kotlin because it is inherently bound to the action itself
    (if the action reads from the file, it is an input),
    while declaring the kind of generated content in `generated:` is not necessarily so: a generic `unzip` action may be
    actually unzipping some sources, and only a concrete plugin may know that, so it needs to convey it at the registration site.

### Naming and addressing

The task name is local to the plugin. Different plugins may use the same task names without conflicts.

#### Internal name

In logs and in the CLI, a task is addressed as `:<module-name>:<task-name>@<plugin-id>`.
This is also what you see in tasks output and what you pass to the task command to [run a task manually](#run-a-task).

!!! info
    The plugin ID is part of the internal task name.
    By default, it is the plugin module name, unless overridden in `pluginInfo.id`
    (read more [here](structure.md#plugin-structure)).

The internal name of a task should not ideally be exposed and used externally. We are working on making it so.

## Contributing back to the build

There are a bunch of things the Kotlin Toolchain build can consume that can be produced by a custom task.
In order to contribute some typed files back to the build, we need the following:

1. To have a necessary path marked as an `@Output` in the task action
2. To add a `generated:` block at the top level of the `plugin.yaml`, declaring the kind of content and referencing the output path.

Currently supported kinds of generated content:

| Section                         | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `generated.sources`             | A directory containing **sources** to be compiled together with the module (`language: kotlin` (default) or `language: java`)                                        |
| `generated.resources`           | A directory containing **resources** to be bundled together with the module                                                                                          |
| `generated.cinteropDefinitions` | A [`.def` file](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-definition-file.html) to be processed by the [`cinterop`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-c-interop.html) tool |

!!! example
    ```yaml hl_lines="9-12"
    tasks:
      generate:
        action: !com.example.generateSources
          propertiesFile: ${module.rootDir}/config.properties
          generatedSourceDir: ${taskOutputDir} #(1)!

    generated:
      sources:
        - language: kotlin
          directory: ${tasks.generate.action.generatedSourceDir}
    ```

    1.    `generatedSourceDir` is `#!kotlin @Output generatedSourceDir: Path` in Kotlin

### Advanced
One can customize the platform and/or main/test scope the content is associated with using the `fragment` clause of each entry in the `generated.*` block.
It has two properties: `modifier: string` and `isTest: boolean`.
The `modifier` string has the same semantics as the suffix one can put after the `@` in the `module.yaml` configuration or
in the names of `src` directories. For example, having:
```yaml
generated:
  sources:
    - language: kotlin
      directory: ${tasks.generate.action.generatedSourceDir}
      fragment:
        isTest: true
        modifier: ios

  cinteropDefinitions:
    - defFile: ${tasks.provideNativeLibs.action.generatedDefFile}
      fragment: native
```
would make the Kotlin Toolchain treat the generated sources as if they were put into the `test@ios` directory.

## Consuming things from the build

!!! warning
    Currently, most of the built‑in configurables used to request things from the build are JVM‑only.

### Requesting layout-agnostic module sources

To request module sources, we can use the built‑in `org.jetbrains.amper.plugins.ModuleSources` configurable.
It should always be marked as `@Input`.
The `includeGenerated` property allows the task to depend on the other code generating steps in the build,
like other custom tasks or KSP, and include their results in `sourceDirectories` as well.

!!! example

    === "someKindOfLinter.kt"
        ```kotlin
        @TaskAction
        fun someKindOfLinter(
            @Input sources: ModuleSources,
            moduleName: String,
        ) {
            sources.sourceDirectories.forEach { dir ->
                println("Module `$moduleName` has $dir as its source directory")
            }
        }
        ```
    === "plugin.yaml (just user sources)"
        ```yaml
        tasks:
          lint:
            action: !someKindOfLinter
              moduleName: ${module.name}
              sources: ${module.sources}
        ```
    === "plugin.yaml (including generated sources)"
        ```yaml
        tasks:
          lint:
            action: !someKindOfLinter
              moduleName: ${module.name}
              sources:
                from: ${module.self}
                includeGenerated: true
        ```

!!! tip
    Using `ModuleSources` even in the simple case is more robust than just referring to `${module.rootDir}/src`,
    because it takes module layout into account (and multiplatform source directories — coming soon).

### Requesting classpath/ad-hoc dependency resolution

The Kotlin Toolchain models a request to get a resolved classpath as the built‑in `org.jetbrains.amper.plugins.Classpath` configurable.
It also must always be an `@Input`.
There are a bunch of convenience reference‑only properties like `module.runtimeClasspath` or `module.compileClasspath`,
but one can also construct a `Classpath` spec to request an ad hoc dependency resolution.

!!! example

    === "packageClasspath.kt"
        ```kotlin
        @TaskAction
        fun packageClasspath(
            @Input appClasspath: Classpath,
            @Input extraClasspath: Classpath?,
        ) {
            appClasspath.resolvedFiles.forEach {  it.copyTo(...) }
            ...
        }
        ```
    === "plugin.yaml"
        ```yaml
        tasks:
          package:
            action: !packageTheApp
              appClasspath: ${module.runtimeClasspath} #(1)!
              extraClasspath: #(2)!
                - foo:bar:1.0
                - ${pluginSettings.extraDependency}
        ```

        1.    A convenience value for the `#!yaml { dependencies: [ ${module.self} ], scope: runtime }`
        2.    Resolves arbitrary dependencies (local, Maven) in the specified scope (`runtime` by default)

### Requesting a module compilation result

As opposed to the `runtimeClasspath`, sometimes we want to get just the JAR that is the result of the module's compilation.
To do that we can refer to the `${module.jar}` which has the `org.jetbrains.amper.plugins.CompilationArtifact` type.

!!! example
    === "copyJar.kt"
        ```kotlin
        @TaskAction
        fun copyJar(jar: CompilationArtifact) {
            jar.artifact.copyTo(...)
        }
        ```
    === "plugin.yaml"
        ```yaml
        tasks:
          copy:
            action: !copyJar
              jar: ${module.jar} #(1)!
        ```

        1.    A convenience value for the `#!yaml { from: ${module.self} }`


## Run a task

If the task [contributes](#contributing-back-to-the-build) something to the build,
it probably doesn't ever need to be invoked explicitly by hand. It is invoked automatically by the build system or tooling
to ensure that generated contents are up to date.

However, there are scenarios where it is necessary to run a task manually.
Currently, there are two use cases that we support: [checks](checks.md#create-checks) and [custom commands](custom-commands.md#create-custom-commands).

!!! note
    There is a way to run a task manually using the `task` command using its internal mangled name. We don't recommend doing that for purposes other than debugging.

    ```shell
    $ ./kotlin task :moduleName:taskName@pluginId
    ```

To see more practical examples of how to write tasks,
you are welcome to check out the [quick start guide](../quick-start.md) and our
plugin samples in the `build-sources` directory of the Kotlin project.

# :android-head-flat: Android application

Use the `android/app` product type in a module to build an Android application.

!!! tip "Using IntelliJ IDEA?"

    Make sure to install the [:android-head-flat: Android plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22989-android) to
    get proper support for Android-specific features.

## Module layout

Here is an overview of the module layout for an Android application:

--8<-- "includes/module-layouts/android-app.md"

## Entry point

The application's entry point is specified in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file according to the
[official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro):

```xml title="src/AndroidManifest.xml"
<manifest ... >
  <application ... >
    <activity android:name="com.example.myapp.MainActivity" ... >
    </activity>
  </application>
</manifest>
```

You can run your application using the `./kotlin run` command.

??? tip "Run in IntelliJ IDEA"

    IntelliJ IDEA with the Kotlin Toolchain plugin automatically detects the `android/app` product type and provides a run
    configuration for it:

    ![](../../images/ij-run-config-android.png)

## Packaging

You can use the `build` command to create an APK, or the `package` command to create an Android Application Bundle (AAB).

The `package` command will not only build the APK, but also minify/obfuscate it with ProGuard, and sign it.
See the dedicated [signing](#signing) and [code shrinking](#code-shrinking) sections below to learn how to configure this.

### Code shrinking

When creating a release build with the Kotlin Toolchain, R8 will be used automatically, with minification and shrinking enabled.
This is equivalent to the following Gradle configuration:

```kotlin
// Gradle equivalent of the Kotlin Toolchain's defaults
isMinifyEnabled = true
isShrinkResources = true
proguardFiles(getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"))
```

You can create a `proguard-rules.pro` file in the module folder to add custom rules for R8.

```
├─ src/
├─ test/
├─ proguard-rules.pro
╰─ module.yaml
```

It is automatically used by the Kotlin Toolchain if present.

An example of how to add custom R8 rules can be found [in the android-app module]({{ examples_base_url }}/compose-multiplatform/android-app/proguard-rules.pro) of the `compose-multiplatform` example project.

### Signing

In a module containing an Android application (using the `android/app` product type) you can enable signing under
settings:

```yaml
settings:
  android:
    signing: enabled
```

This will use a `keystore.properties` file located in the module folder for the signing details by default. This
properties file must contain the following signing details. **Remember that these details should usually not be added
to version control.**

```properties
storeFile=/Users/example/.keystores/release.keystore
storePassword=store_password
keyAlias=alias
keyPassword=key_password
```

To customize the path to this file, you can use the `propertiesFile` option:

```yaml
settings:
  android:
    signing:
      enabled: true
      propertiesFile: ./keystore.properties # default value
```

You can use `./kotlin tool generate-keystore` to generate a new keystore if you don't have one yet.
This will create a new self-signed certificate, using the details in the `keystore.properties` file.

!!! note

    You can also pass in these details to `generate-keystore` as command line arguments. Invoke the tool with `--help`
    to learn more.

## Parcelize

If you want to automatically generate your `Parcelable` implementations, you can enable
[Parcelize](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/parcelize) as follows:

```yaml
settings:
  android:
    parcelize: enabled
```

With this simple toggle, the following class gets its `Parcelable` implementation automatically without spelling it out
in the code, just thanks to the `@Parcelize` annotation:
```kotlin
import kotlinx.parcelize.Parcelize

@Parcelize
class User(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, val age: Int): Parcelable
```

While this is only relevant on Android, sometimes you need to share your data model between multiple platforms.
However, the `Parcelable` interface and `@Parcelize` annotation are only present on Android.
But fear not, there is a solution described in the
[official documentation](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/parcelize#setup_parcelize_for_kotlin_multiplatform).
In short:

* For `android.os.Parcelable`, you can use the `expect`/`actual` mechanism to define your own interface as typealias of
  `android.os.Parcelable` (for Android), and as an empty interface for other platforms.
* For `@Parcelize`, you can simply define your own annotation instead, and then tell Parcelize about it (see below).

For example, in common code:
```kotlin
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.BINARY)
annotation class MyParcelize

expect interface MyParcelable
```
Then in Android code:
```kotlin
actual typealias MyParcelable = android.os.Parcelable
```
And in other platforms:
```kotlin
// empty because nothing is generated on non-Android platforms
actual interface MyParcelable
```

You can then make Parcelize recognize this custom annotation using the `additionalAnnotations` option:

```yaml
settings:
  kotlin:
    # for the expect/actual MyParcelable interface
    freeCompilerArgs: [ -Xexpect-actual-classes ]
  android:
    parcelize:
      enabled: true
      additionalAnnotations: [ com.example.MyParcelize ]
```


## Google Services and Firebase

To enable the [`google-services` plugin](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin), place
your `google-services.json` file in the module containing an `android/app` product, next to `module.yaml`.

```
╰─ androidApp/
   ├─ src/
   ├─ google-services.json
   ╰─ module.yaml
```

This file will be found and consumed automatically.

# Product types

Each module has a product type defined by the `product` field in `module.yaml`, indicating what is created when building
this module.

This section contains subsections describing the specific aspects of each product type.
Here is the list of supported product types:

# :simple-apple: iOS application

Use the `ios/app` product type in a module to build an iOS application.

!!! tip "Using IntelliJ IDEA?"

    Make sure to install the
    [:jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
    to get proper support for Kotlin/Native and iOS.

## Module layout

Here is an overview of the module layout for an iOS application:

--8<-- "includes/module-layouts/ios-app.md"

## Entry point

For iOS applications, the entry point is expected to be a `@main` struct in any Swift file in the `src` folder.

<div class="grid" markdown>
``` hl_lines="2"
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.swift
│  ╰─ ...
├─ module.yaml
╰─ module.xcodeproj
```

```swift title="src/main.swift"
...
@main
struct iosApp: App {
   ...
}
```
</div>

This is not customizable at the moment.

## Xcode Project

Currently, an Xcode project is required to build an iOS application in the Kotlin Toolchain.
It has to be named `module.xcodeproj` and located in the `ios/app` module root directory.

Normally, when the Kotlin project is created via `kotlin init` or via the IDE's Wizard, the appropriate Xcode project is
already there. This is currently the recommended way of creating projects that have an iOS app module.

However, if the Kotlin project is created from scratch, the default buildable Xcode project will be created automatically
after the first project build.
This project can later be customized and checked into a VCS.

If you want to migrate an existing Xcode project so it has Kotlin Toolchain support, you must manually ensure that:

1. it is named `module.xcodeproj` and is located in the root of the `ios/app` module
2. it has a single iOS application target
3. the target has `Debug` & `Release` build configurations, each containing `KOTLIN_CLI_WRAPPER_PATH = <relative path to Kotlin wrapper script>`.
   The path is relative to the Kotlin module root.
4. the target has a script build phase called `Build Kotlin with Amper` with the code:
   ```bash
    # !AMPER KMP INTEGRATION STEP!
    # This script is managed by the Kotlin Toolchain, do not edit manually!
    "${KOTLIN_CLI_WRAPPER_PATH}" tool xcode-integration
   ```
5. The _Framework Search Paths_ (`FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS`) option contains the `$(TARGET_BUILD_DIR)/AmperFrameworks` value

Changes to the Xcode project that do not break these requirements are allowed.

So the iOS app module layout looks like this:
```
├─ src/
│  ├─ KotlinCode.kt      # optional, if all the code is in the libraries
│  ├─ EntryPoint.swift
│  ├─ Info.plist
├─ module.yaml           # ios/app
╰─ module.xcodeproj      # xcode project
```

!!! tip

    The Xcode project can be built normally from the Xcode IDE, if needed.

## Swift support

!!! info

    Swift sources are only fully supported in the `src` directory of the `ios/app` module.

While swift sources are, strictly speaking, managed by the Xcode project and, as such,
can reside in arbitrary locations, it's not recommended to have them anywhere outside the `src` directory - the tooling
might not work correctly.

To use Kotlin code from Swift, one must import the `KotlinModules` framework.
This framework is built from:

1. the code inside the `ios/app` module itself
2. the modules that `ios/app` module depends on (e.g. `- ../shared`)
3. all the external dependencies, transitively

!!! note

    All declarations from the source Kotlin code are accessible to Swift, but external dependencies are not.

# :material-language-javascript: Kotlin/JS application

Use the `js/app` product type in a module to build a JavaScript application using the
[Kotlin/JS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-overview.html) technology.
These applications can be run in browsers or Node.js.

!!! warning "Incomplete preview"

    The support for this product type is currently in an incomplete preview state.

    For example, running a JavaScript application is not supported out of the box at the moment like other application
    types, and needs some manual work (see the [Running your application](#running-your-application)).

    We're eager to hear more about your use cases and how we can improve this experience!
    Please let us know in a [:jetbrains-youtrack: YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/AMPER) issue, or in
    our [:material-slack: Slack channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C062WG3A7T8).

!!! tip "Using IntelliJ IDEA?"

    Make sure to install the
    [:jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
    to get proper support for Kotlin/JS.

## Module layout

Here is an overview of the module layout for a JavaScript application:

```
my-module/
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.kt
│  ╰─ Util.kt
├─ test/
│  ╰─ UtilTest.kt
╰─ module.yaml
```

## Entry point

The entry point of a Kotlin/JS application is a top-level `main` function in the `src` folder.

Multiple `main` functions are not supported. If you have multiple main functions, the one chosen by the compiler as
an entry point is unspecified.

## Packaging

You can use the `build` command to compile your code to a JavaScript module file (`.mjs`) for your application.
It cannot be run directly by the Kotlin CLI, but you can run it using Node.js or in a browser via an HTML page.

The `.mjs` file is produced in the `build/tasks/_<module-name>_linkJs` folder at the moment, but this is subject to
change.

There is no extra packaging facilities at the moment, and the `package` command is not supported for this product type.

## Running your application

!!! warning "Kotlin/JS applications cannot be run directly by the Kotlin CLI at the moment."

To run your application, you need to:

1. Install a JavaScript runtime (e.g., Node.js or a browser)
2. Build your module with `./kotlin build`
3. Run the `.mjs` file produced by your module using your JavaScript runtime.
   See the [Packaging](#packaging) section above to know where this file is located.

# :intellij-java: JVM application

Use the `jvm/app` product type in a module to build a JVM console or desktop application.

## Module layout

Here is an overview of the module layout for a JVM application:

--8<-- "includes/module-layouts/jvm-app.md"

!!! note "Maven compatibility layout for JVM-only modules"

    If you're migrating from Maven, you can also configure the [Maven-like layout](../advanced/maven-like-layout.md)

## Entry point

By default, the entry point of JVM applications (the `main` function) is expected to be in a `main.kt` file
(case-insensitive) in the `src` folder.
The `main` function must either have no parameters or one `Array<String>` parameter (representing the command line arguments).

This can be overridden by specifying a main class explicitly in the module settings:
```yaml
product: jvm/app

settings:
  jvm:
    mainClass: org.example.myapp.MyMainKt
```

!!! note

    In Kotlin, unlike Java, the `main` function doesn't have to be declared in a class, and is usually at the top level
    of the file. However, the JVM still expects a main class when running any application. Kotlin always compiles
    top-level declarations to a class, and the name of that class is derived from the name of the file by capitalizing
    the name and turning the `.kt` extension into a `Kt` suffix.

    For example, the top-level declarations of `myMain.kt` will be in a class named `MyMainKt`.

## Packaging

You can use the `build` command to produce a regular JAR of your application's code, or the `package`
command to produce an [Executable JAR](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/specification/executable-jar/index.html).

The executable JAR format is developed by the [Spring](https://spring.io/) team, hence why you might see the
`spring-boot-loader` embedded in it.
That being said, this format is a universal packaging solution suitable for any JVM application.
It provides a convenient, runnable self-contained deployment unit that includes all necessary dependencies.

!!! question "Why not create an Über JAR (a.k.a Fat JAR)?"

    The usual "Über JAR" (a.k.a "Fat JAR") format is quite popular: it just contains the contents of all your dependency
    JARs, merge with your own classes and resources. This approach has issues that stem from this unpacking/repacking of
    JARs. For example:

      * signature files are no longer valid after the merge, which can render some security libraries invalid
      * `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` files are duplicated in many JARs, and thus need to be discarded or merged
      * service loader resources also may have conflicting names and need to be merged
      * any other duplicate class/resource file need to be handle in custom ways, which have to be configurable

    The executable JAR format doesn't have these problems because it keeps the original JARs intact – it just embeds
    them and loads them on-demand.

# :intellij-java: JVM library

Use the `jvm/lib` product type in a module to build a JVM library.

## Module layout

Here is an overview of the module layout for a JVM library:

```shell
my-module/
├─ resources/ # (1)!
│  ╰─ logback.xml # (2)!
├─ src/
│  ├─ lib.kt
│  ╰─ Util.java # (3)!
├─ test/
│  ╰─ LibTest.java # (4)!
│  ╰─ UtilTest.kt
├─ testResources/
│  ╰─ logback-test.xml # (5)!
╰─ module.yaml
```

1. Resources placed here are copied into the resulting JAR.
2. This is just an example resource and can be omitted.
3. You can mix Kotlin and Java source files in a single module, all in the `src` folder.
4. You can test Java code with Kotlin tests or Kotlin code with Java tests.
5. This is just an example resource and can be omitted.

!!! note "Maven compatibility layout for JVM-only modules"

    If you're migrating from Maven, you can also configure the [Maven-like layout](../advanced/maven-like-layout.md)

## Packaging

The `kotlin package` command isn't defined _by default_ for JVM libraries.

If [publishing](../publishing.md) to Maven Central is enabled, then `kotlin package` creates a Maven Central ZIP bundle
that is ready to be uploaded to the Central Portal.
More specifically, enabling Maven Central publication provides the `maven-central-bundle` packaging format, and because
it's the only one, it means the `kotlin package` command is effectively `kotlin package --format=maven-central-bundle`.

## Publishing

The `kotlin publish <repository>` command can be used to publish the library to a Maven repository.
Read more about this in the [publishing](../publishing.md) guide.

# :fontawesome-solid-microchip: Kotlin/Native application

Native applications are applications that run on the host operating system.
There are several product types for the supported target platforms:

- `linux/app` - a native Linux application
- `macos/app` - a native macOS application
- `windows/app` - a native Windows application

!!! tip "Using IntelliJ IDEA?"

    Make sure to install the
    [:jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
    to get proper support for Kotlin/Native.

## Module layout

Here is an overview of the module layout for a Kotlin/Native application:

```shell
my-module/
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.kt #(1)!
│  ╰─ Util.kt
├─ test/
│  ╰─ UtilTest.kt
╰─ module.yaml
```

1. This is the conventional entry point location (contains a top-level `fun main()`).
   See [Entry point](#entry-point) below.

## Entry point

By default, the entry point of a Kotlin native application is expected to be a top-level `main` function in a `main.kt`
file (case-insensitive) in the `src` folder.

If you don't want to follow this convention, you can specifty the fully qualified name of the entry point function
explicitly in the module settings:

```yaml
product: linux/app

settings:
  native:
    entryPoint: org.example.myapp.myMainFun # (1)!
```

1. The fully qualified name of the entry point function.

The entry point function must either have **no parameters or one `Array<String>` parameter** (representing the command
line arguments).

## Packaging

You can use the `build` command to compile and link a native executable for your application (a `.exe` on Windows, or
`.kexe` otherwise).

There is no extra packaging facilities at the moment, and the `package` command is not supported for these native
product types.

# :simple-webassembly: Kotlin/Wasm application

Use the `wasm-js/app` or `wasm-wasi/app` product type in a module to build a WebAssembly application using the
[Kotlin/Wasm](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/wasm-overview.html) technology.
These applications can be run in browsers or Node.js.

!!! warning "Incomplete preview"

    The support for this product type is currently in an incomplete preview state.

    For example, running a WebAssembly application is not supported out of the box at the moment like other application
    types, and needs some manual work (see the [Running your application](#running-your-application)).

    We're eager to hear more about your use cases and how we can improve this experience!
    Please let us know in a [:jetbrains-youtrack: YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/AMPER) issue, or in
    our [:material-slack: Slack channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C062WG3A7T8).

!!! tip "Using IntelliJ IDEA?"

    Make sure to install the
    [:jetbrains-kotlin-multiplatform: Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
    to get proper support for Kotlin/Wasm.

## Module layout

Here is an overview of the module layout for a Kotlin/Wasm application:

```shell
my-module/
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.kt
│  ╰─ Util.kt
├─ test/
│  ╰─ UtilTest.kt
╰─ module.yaml
```

## Entry point

The entry point of a Kotlin/Wasm application is a top-level `main` function in the `src` folder.

Multiple `main` functions are not supported. If you have multiple main functions, the one chosen by the compiler as
an entry point is unspecified.

## Packaging

Using the `build` command compiles your code to WebAssembly (`.wasm` file) and generate a JavaScript wrapper file
(`.mjs`) to load it.

These files are produced in the `build/tasks/_<module-name>_linkWasmJs` (for `wasm-js/app`) or
`build/tasks/_<module-name>_linkWasmWasi` (for `wasm-wasi/app`) folder at the moment, but this is subject to change.

There is no extra packaging facilities at the moment, and the `package` command is not supported for this product type.

## Running your application

!!! warning "Kotlin/Wasm applications cannot be run directly by the Kotlin CLI at the moment."

To run your application, you need to:

1. Install a JavaScript runtime that supports WebAssembly (e.g., Node.js, D8, a browser, ...).
2. Build your module with `./kotlin build`
3. Using your JS runtime, run the `.mjs` wrapper file that calls the `.wasm` code produced by your module.
   See the [Packaging](#packaging) section above to know where this file is located.

# Publishing libraries

!!! info "The publishing feature is in preview, and is likely to change. Don't hesitate to share your feedback!"

!!! warning "Multiplatform library publication is not supported yet"

    At the moment, only JVM libraries can be published.
    While the `publish` command for KMP libraries will not complain, the KMP publications are for now incomplete and
    not consumable by other projects.

Library modules inside your project are useful for modularization, but you can take it one step further by publishing
your libraries so they can be used by other projects.

With a little bit of configuration, you'll be able to publish using the `kotlin publish` command.

## Publishing to a regular Maven repository

To publish to a Maven repository, you essentially need 3 things:

* the publication configuration
* the target repository
* the credentials to publish

This is how your `module.yaml` should look like:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/lib

repositories:
  - id: someIdOfYourChoosing #(1)!
    url: https://maven.pkg.github.com/my-org/my-repo #(2)!
    publish: true #(3)!
    credentials:
      file: creds.properties # a properties file containing your credentials
      usernameKey: username # not the username, but the name of the property containing it
      passwordKey: password # not the password, but the name of the property containing it

settings:
  publishing:
    enabled: true
    group: org.example # enter your own groupID here
    version: 1.0.0
    # artifactId is optional, and defaults to your module's name
```

1. This is the ID you will use in the `publish` command when you want to publish to this repository:
   ```
   kotlin publish <id>
   ```

2. The URL of your custom repository

3. Enables publishing to this repository via the `kotlin publish <repoId>` command

You must then also create a `creds.properties` file (or whichever name you chose above), with two properties for the
username and password to use for publishing:

```
username=adele
password=imRollingInTheDeep
```

Once everything is set up, use the following command to publish all modules that enabled publishing (and that have
configured a repository with ID `someIdOfYourChoosing`):

```
kotlin publish someIdOfYourChoosing
```

!!! note "Don't forget to publish your dependencies"

    If your module depends on other local modules, you must enable publishing for these other modules too.
    We recommend using a template to share the publishing configuration across all your published modules.

## Publishing to Maven Central

Maven Central is the most popular Maven repository. Most OSS libraries are published there.
Publishing your library to Maven Central makes it easier for your users to consume it.

### Prerequisites

To publish to Maven Central, you need to have:

* a Central Portal [account](https://central.sonatype.org/register/central-portal/)
* a Central Portal [namespace](https://central.sonatype.org/register/namespace/)
* a Central Portal [user token](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/generate-portal-token/) - remember the username and password parts.

### Configuration

There are a handful of requirements[^1] imposed by Sonatype to publish to Maven Central:

[^1]: You can learn more about them [on the official website](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/)

* javadocs and sources JARs must be published
* checksums for all artifacts must be published
* artifacts need to be signed with a PGP signature
* some mandatory metadata about the module must be present

You can satisfy all of these requirements with a little bit of configuration:

```yaml
product: jvm/lib

description: A meaningful description for this specific module

settings:
  publishing:
    enabled: true
    group: com.example #(1)!
    version: 1.0.0
    # artifactId is optional, and defaults to your module's name
    mavenCentral: enabled
    signArtifacts: true
    publishSources: true
    pom:
      url: https://example.com
      scm: https://github.com/my-org/example.git #(2)!
      developers:
        - name: Joffrey Bion
      licenses:
        - name: MIT
          url: https://opensource.org/license/mit
```

1. The `group` should correspond to the `groupId` of your Maven Central
   [namespace](https://central.sonatype.org/register/namespace/)
2. This is a shorthand for `pom.scm.url`.
   The `pom.scm.connection` and `pom.scm.developerConnection` are automatically derived from it using the value `scm:git:$url`.
   If this default doesn't work for you, you can set these properties explicitly to any value.

!!! note "Empty JavaDoc jar"

    At the moment, an empty JavaDoc JAR is added to the publication by default. We will soon add more control over this.

### Passing credentials

In order to publish using `kotlin publish mavenCentral`, you'll need to provide credentials in the form of environment
variables (usually done on the CI):

| Variable                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `KOTLIN_TOOLCHAIN_MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME` | The `username` part of your Central Portal [user token](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/generate-portal-token/).                                                  |
| `KOTLIN_TOOLCHAIN_MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD` | The `password` part of your Central Portal [user token](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/generate-portal-token/).                                                  |
| `KOTLIN_TOOLCHAIN_SIGNING_KEY`            | The ASCII-armored PGP signing key to use to sign artifacts. You can export a private key in this format using the `gpg --export-secret-keys --armor <KEY_ID>` command. |
| `KOTLIN_TOOLCHAIN_SIGNING_KEY_PASSPHRASE` | (optional) The passphrase to unlock the PGP key, if there is one.                                                                                                      |

!!! question "How do I get a PGP signing key?"

    If you have never needed a PGP signing key before, it might not be obvious to get started.
    Follow the instructions to [create and prepare a key](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg) on the
    Maven Central website.

### Publishing command

Use the following command to publish all modules that have `mavenCentral` publication enabled:

```
kotlin publish mavenCentral
```

This is usually done in a CI job.

### Publishing mode

The Kotlin Toolchain provides 2 modes for publishing:

* `manual` (default): in this mode, the `kotlin publish` command uploads the bundle, then waits for its validation, and
   then stops for manual verification. Once you're ready, you can use the
   [Central Portal UI](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments) to manually publish (release) your
   artifacts.
* `auto`: the `kotlin publish` command does everything automatically from end to finish. This is useful when you want
   to fully automate your publications.

By default, the Kotlin Toolchain uses the `manual` mode, to avoid surprises.
Once the first deployment is successful, you might want to streamline the publication by switching to `auto` mode.
This can be done using `settings.mavenCentral.publishingMode: auto`.

!!! warning "One does not simply remove artifacts from Maven Central"

    When using the `auto` mode, you will not get a chance to look at the published artifacts before they are released to
    the public and set in stone in Maven Central. If there is a mistake in your publication, you will not be able to
    remove artifacts from Maven Central, because Sonatype has a strict policy about this.

# Templates

In modularized projects, there is often a need to have a certain common configuration for all or some modules.
Typical examples could be a testing framework used in all modules or a Kotlin language version.

The Kotlin Toolchain offers a way to extract whole sections or their parts into reusable template files.
These files are named `<name>.module-template.yaml` and have the same structure as `module.yaml` files.

A templates is applied to a `module.yaml` file by it to the `apply:` section:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

apply:
  - ../common.module-template.yaml
```

```yaml title="../common.module-template.yaml"
test-dependencies:
  - org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test:1.8.10

settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.8
```

Sections in the template can also have `@platform`-qualifiers.

!!! note

    Template files can't have `product:` and `apply:` sections (they can't be recursive).

Templates are applied one by one, using the same rules as
[platform-specific dependencies and settings](multiplatform.md#dependencysettings-propagation):

- Scalar values (strings, numbers etc.) are overridden.
- Mappings and lists are appended.

Settings and dependencies from the `module.yaml` file are applied last. The position of the `apply:` section doesn't matter, the `module.yaml` file content always has precedence E.g.

```yaml title="common.module-template.yaml"
dependencies:
  - ../shared

settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.8
  compose: enabled
```

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

apply:
  - ./common.module-template.yaml

dependencies:
  - ../jvm-util

settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.9
  jvm:
    release: 8
```

After applying the template the resulting effective module is:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

dependencies:  # lists appended
  - ../shared
  - ../jvm-util

settings:  # objects merged
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.9  # module.yaml overwrites value
  compose: enabled        # from the template
  jvm:
    release: 8   # from the module.yaml
```

# Testing

Test code is located in the `test/` folder:

```
├─ src/            # production code
├─ test/           # test code
│  ├─ MainTest.kt
│  ╰─ ...
╰─ module.yaml
```

By default, the [Kotlin test](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/) framework is preconfigured for each
platform. Additional test-only dependencies should be added to the `test-dependencies:` section of your module
configuration file:

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product: jvm/app

# these dependencies are available in main and test code
dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0

# additional dependencies for test code
test-dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-server-test-host:2.2.0
```

To add or override [toolchain settings](basics.md#settings) in tests, use the `test-settings:` section:
```yaml title="module.yaml"
# these dependencies are available in main and test code
settings:
  kotlin:
    ...

# additional test-specific setting
test-settings:
  kotlin:
    ...
```

Test settings and dependencies by default are inherited from the main configuration according to the
[configuration propagation rules](multiplatform.md#dependencysettings-propagation).
Example:
```
├─ src/
├─ src@ios/
├─ test/           # Sees declarations from src/. Executed on all platforms.
│  ├─ MainTest.kt
│  ╰─ ...
├─ test@ios/       # Sees declarations from src/, src@ios/, and `test/`. Executed on iOS platforms only.
│  ├─ IOSTest.kt
│  ╰─ ...
╰─ module.yaml
```

```yaml title="module.yaml"
product:
  type: kmp/lib
  platforms: [android, iosArm64]

# these dependencies are available in main and test code
dependencies:
  - io.ktor:ktor-client-core:2.2.0

# dependencies for test code
test-dependencies:
  - org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test:1.8.10

# these settings affect the main and test code
settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.8

# these settings affect tests only
test-settings:
  kotlin:
    languageVersion: 1.9 # overrides settings.kotlin.languageVersion 1.8
```

description: A brief introduction to the YAML language used in Kotlin Toolchain configuration files.
---
# Brief YAML primer

The Kotlin Toolchain uses (a subset of) the YAML language for configuration files.

YAML describes a tree of mappings and values.
Mappings have key-value pairs and can be nested.
Values can be scalars (string, numbers, booleans) and sequences (lists, sets).
YAML is indent-sensitive.

Here is a [cheat-sheet](https://quickref.me/yaml.html) and [YAML 1.2 specification](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/).

Strings can be quoted or unquoted. These are equivalent:

```yaml
string1: foo bar
string2: "foo bar"
string3: 'foo bar'
```

Mapping:

```yaml
mapping-name:
  field1: foo bar
  field2: 1.2
```

List of values (strings):

```yaml
list-name:
  - foo bar
  - "bar baz"
```

List of mapping:

```yaml
list-name:
  - named-mapping:
      field1: x
      field2: y
  - field1: x
    field2: y
```
